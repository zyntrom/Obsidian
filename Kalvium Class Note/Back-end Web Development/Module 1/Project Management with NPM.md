# ✅ **PROJECT MANAGEMENT WITH NPM — EXAM NOTES**

## 1. What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js.  
It manages:

- Third-party libraries (dependencies)
- Versions of installed packages
- Scripts for automating tasks
- Project metadata through `package.json`

---

## 2. package.json (Project Blueprint)

`package.json` is the central configuration file for any Node.js project.

### Contains:

- **Metadata**: name, version, description, author, license
- **Dependencies**: external packages needed to run the project
- **DevDependencies**: packages needed only during development
- **Scripts**: command shortcuts (start, dev, test)

### How to create:
```bash
npm init
```

or non-interactive:

```bash
npm init -y
```

---

## 3. Installing Dependencies

### Production dependencies:

Needed for the application to run.

```bash
npm install express
```

Saved automatically to `"dependencies"` in `package.json`.

### Development dependencies:

Needed only during development.

```bash
npm install nodemon -D
```

Saved under `"devDependencies"`.

---

## 4. node_modules (Local Package Storage)

- A folder automatically created after installing packages.
- Contains the actual source code for all dependencies and their sub-dependencies.
- Can grow very large.
- **You never commit this folder to Git.**
- Must be listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## 5. package-lock.json (Lockfile)

This file is automatically generated when installing packages.

### It contains:

- Exact dependency versions installed
- Complete dependency tree
- Integrity hashes to verify package content
- Ensures deterministic installs

### Purpose:

- Guarantees that every environment (developer machines, CI/CD, production servers) installs **identical versions** of all packages.
- Prevents breaking changes caused by version mismatches.
- Allows NPM to optimize installs by caching and verifying integrity.

### Important rule:

- **You always commit package-lock.json to Git.**
- It ensures reproducibility, stability, and consistent builds.

---

## 6. NPM Scripts

Defined inside the `"scripts"` section of `package.json`.

Example:

```json
"scripts": {   
	"start": "node src/index.js",   
	"dev": "nodemon src/index.js" 
}
```

### Usage:

Run scripts using:

```bash
npm run dev 
npm run start
```

- `start`: conventional production start command
- `dev`: uses nodemon for auto-reload during development

---

## 7. .gitignore

A special file used to exclude unnecessary files/folders from Git.

### Common rule:

```
node_modules
```
