# ✅ **PROJECT MANAGEMENT WITH NPM — EXAM NOTES**

## 1. What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js.  
It manages:

- Third-party libraries (dependencies)
- Versions of installed packages
- Scripts for automating tasks
- Project metadata through `package.json`

---

## 2. package.json (Project Blueprint)

`package.json` is the central configuration file for any Node.js project.

### Contains:

- **Metadata**: name, version, description, author, license
- **Dependencies**: external packages needed to run the project
- **DevDependencies**: packages needed only during development
- **Scripts**: command shortcuts (start, dev, test)

### How to create:
```bash
npm init
```

or non-interactive:

```bash
npm init -y
```

---

## 3. Installing Dependencies

### Production dependencies:

Needed for the application to run.

```bash
npm install express
```

Saved automatically to `"dependencies"` in `package.json`.

### Development dependencies:

Needed only during development.

```bash
npm install nodemon -D
```

Saved under `"devDependencies"`.

---

## 4. node_modules (Local Package Storage)

- A folder automatically created after installing packages.
- Contains the actual source code for all dependencies and their sub-dependencies.
- Can grow very large.
- **You never commit this folder to Git.**
- Must be listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## 5. package-lock.json (Lockfile)

This file is automatically generated when installing packages.

### It contains:

- Exact dependency versions installed
- Complete dependency tree
- Integrity hashes to verify package content
- Ensures deterministic installs

### Purpose:

- Guarantees that every environment (developer machines, CI/CD, production servers) installs **identical versions** of all packages.
- Prevents breaking changes caused by version mismatches.
    
- Allows NPM to optimize installs by caching and verifying integrity.
    

### Important rule:

- **You always commit package-lock.json to Git.**
    
- It ensures reproducibility, stability, and consistent builds.
    

---

## 6. NPM Scripts

Defined inside the `"scripts"` section of `package.json`.

Example:

`"scripts": {   "start": "node src/index.js",   "dev": "nodemon src/index.js" }`

### Usage:

Run scripts using:

`npm run dev npm run start`

- `start`: conventional production start command
    
- `dev`: uses nodemon for auto-reload during development
    

---

## 7. .gitignore

A special file used to exclude unnecessary files/folders from Git.

### Common rule:

`node_modules`

---

# ✅ **EXAM QUESTION: Explain the Role of package-lock.json**

Here is the exact, clean answer you can write in your exam:

---

### ✅ **Assignment Answer: Role of package-lock.json**

`package-lock.json` is an automatically generated file that records the exact versions of every package and sub-package installed in a Node.js project. It preserves a complete dependency tree along with integrity hashes.

**Its main role is to guarantee reproducible installations.**  
It ensures that every developer and every deployment environment installs the same package versions, preventing inconsistencies or unexpected behavior caused by version updates. NPM uses the lockfile to verify package integrity, speed up installation, and maintain deterministic builds.  
This file must always be committed to the repository.
