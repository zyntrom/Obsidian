# ✅ **1. Purpose of This Chapter**

This section explains:

- What you need to install to start backend development with Node.js
- What Node.js actually includes
- The roles of **Node.js** and **NPM**
- How to install and verify them on different operating systems

---

# ✅ **2. What You Install When You Install Node.js**

When you install Node.js, you actually get two major tools:

### **A. Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)**

Technical function:

- Executes JavaScript directly on your operating system (not in a browser)
- Provides system-level capabilities through core modules (fs, http, os, path, etc.)
- Uses the **V8 JavaScript Engine**
- Supports **asynchronous, event-driven** backend architecture
- Allows creation of servers, CLIs, scripts, and APIs

Key features:

- **V8 Engine**  
    Compiles JavaScript to optimized machine code (JIT compilation).
- **Core Modules**  
    Built-in libraries that interact with the OS:
    
    - `fs` → file system operations
        
    - `http` / `https` → server creation and network tasks
        
    - `os` → system info
        
    - `crypto` → hashing/encryption
        
    - `path` → path utilities
        

### **B. NPM (Node Package Manager)**

NPM is installed automatically with Node.js.

Technical role:

- Manages external libraries (“packages”)
    
- Downloads packages from the global NPM registry
    
- Handles versioning, updates, and dependencies
    
- Creates and manages **package.json**, the project manifest
    

Use cases:

- Install frameworks (Express, React, Mongoose)
    
- Install development tools (nodemon, ESLint)
    
- Install production libraries (bcrypt, multer, jwt tokens)
    

Key commands:

`npm init npm install <package> npm uninstall <package> npm install --save-dev <package>`

# ✅ **3. Why LTS Version Is Used**

**LTS (Long-Term Support)** versions are:

- Stable
    
- Recommended for production
    
- Receive security updates and critical fixes
    
- Supported longer than “Current” versions
    

For backend development, LTS ensures:

- Fewer breaking changes
    
- Higher stability
    
- Better compatibility with packages

# ✅ **4. Installation Instructions (Technical Steps)**

## **A. Windows Installation**

1. Download the `.msi` installer from [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    
2. Run the installer:
    
    - Accept license
        
    - Keep default installation path
        
    - Install required features
        
3. Do **not** enable additional tools like Chocolatey (not needed here)
    
4. Finish installation
    

## **B. macOS Installation**

1. Download the `.pkg` installer
    
2. Run installer
    
3. Accept license, install, and complete the setup
    

## **C. Linux Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)**

Most recommended method: **nvm** (Node Version Manager)

Steps:

`sudo apt update sudo apt install curl`

Install NVM:

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash`

Close and reopen terminal, then install Node LTS:

`nvm install --lts`

NVM allows:

- Switching Node versions
    
- Installing multiple versions
    
- Avoiding system-wide conflicts
    

---

# ✅ **5. Verifying Installation**

Run these commands in the terminal:

### **Check Node.js version**

`node -v`

### **Check NPM version**

`npm -v`

If both show version numbers, installation is correct.

---

# ✅ **6. The Role of `package.json`**

When you run:

`npm init`

NPM generates `package.json`.

It stores:

- Project metadata
    
- Installed dependencies
    
- Scripts
    
- Version info
    

This allows:

- Reproducible installations
    
- Easy collaboration
    
- Automated setup with `npm install`

# ✅ **7. Assignment Summary (Technical Steps)**

For submission:

1. Open terminal (Git Bash for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux)
    
2. Run:
    
    `node -v npm -v`
    
3. Take a screenshot with both commands visible
    
4. Upload screenshot
    

---

# ✅ **8. Summary (For Quick Revision)**

- Node.js = JavaScript runtime + V8 engine + core system modules
    
- NPM = package manager + dependency manager
    
- Install the LTS version for stability
    
- Use NVM on Linux for version control
    
- Verify installation with `node -v` and `npm -v`
    
- `package.json` is essential for managing project dependencies
