# 🌐 6.8 State Management Challenges: Prop Drilling

---

## 🔹 What is Prop Drilling?

- **Prop drilling** occurs when you pass data through multiple nested components just to reach the one that needs it.
- Intermediary components **don’t use the data**, they only pass it along.

**Analogy:** Like passing a hammer down a long chain of workers to the one who actually needs it.

**Example:**

```js
function App() {
  const user = { name: "john", avatar: "john.jpg" };
  return <DashboardLayout><ContentArea><UserProfile user={user} /></ContentArea></DashboardLayout>;
}

```

- `DashboardLayout` and `ContentArea` don’t need `user`—they just forward it.

## 🔹 Problems with Prop Drilling

1. **Hard to maintain** – changes require updating multiple components.
2. **Reduces reusability** – components expect props they don’t need.
3. **Performance issues** – unnecessary re-renders of intermediate components.

**When it becomes problematic:**

- Deeply nested components
- Passing lots of props
- Reusing components that depend on distant data

## 🔹 Strategies to Avoid Prop Drilling

### 1️⃣ Context API

- Creates a **shared data store** accessible by only the components that need it.

```js
const UserContext = React.createContext(null);

function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState({ name: "john", avatar: "john.jpg" });
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      <UserProfile />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

function UserProfile() {
  const { user } = React.useContext(UserContext);
  return <h1>{user.name}</h1>;
}

```

---

### 2️⃣ Redux / Other State Libraries

- Centralized **global state** accessible anywhere.
- Ideal for **large, complex apps**.

```js
const user = Redux.useSelector(state => state);
```

---

### 3️⃣ Render Props & Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

- **Render Props:** pass a function as a child to provide data.
- **HOCs:** wrap a component to inject props or logic.

```js
// HOC example 
const EnhancedUserProfile = withUserHOC(UserProfile);
```

---

### 4️⃣ Component Composition

- Reduce unnecessary nesting. Only pass props to components that **actually need them**.

```js
function App() {
  const user = { name: "john", avatar: "john.jpg" };
  return <UserCard user={user} />;
}

```

## 🔹 Key Takeaways

1. Prop drilling = passing props through layers unnecessarily.
2. Causes maintenance, reusability, and performance issues.
3. Solutions:
    - **Context API** → simple, React-native
    - **Redux / MobX** → complex apps
    - **Render Props / HOCs** → logic reuse
    - **Component Composition** → flatten the tree

## 🔹 Reflection & Task

- Think of a real-world scenario with deep prop passing.
- Decide whether to refactor with Context, Redux, or simpler composition.
- Discuss trade-offs with peers.
