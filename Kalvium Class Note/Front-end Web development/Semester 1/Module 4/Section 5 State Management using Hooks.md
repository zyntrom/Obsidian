# React State Management using Hooks

## Story of Hooks

- **Before Hooks**: State management was possible only in **class components**. They were powerful but clunky (like **manual gears** in a car).
- **With Hooks**: Functional components got built-in tools to handle state and side effects (like **automatic gears**) â†’ cleaner, faster, reusable logic.

## Key Hooks and Their Analogies

|Hook|Primary Use|Analogy|
|---|---|---|
|**useState**|Manages local component state|Sticky notes â†’ quick, personal notes|
|**useEffect**|Handles side effects (after events)|Reminder app â†’ alerts after events|
|**useContext**|Shares global state across components|Wi-Fi router â†’ connect once, access everywhere|
|**useReducer**|Handles complex state logic|Traffic controller â†’ organizes many changes|
|**useRef**|References values/DOM elements|Bookmark â†’ remembers position/value|
|**useMemo**|Optimizes expensive calculations|Speed dial â†’ saves time by reusing results|
|**useCallback**|Optimizes function references|Prepped ingredients â†’ ready for reuse|

ðŸ‘‰ In this lesson, focus is on **useState, useEffect, useContext**.  
ðŸ‘‰ Advanced (Part 2) will cover **useReducer, useMemo, useCallback**.

## useState: Local State Management

- **Definition**: Manages state inside a single component.
- **Analogy**: Magic whiteboard â€” you can write, erase, and rewrite data anytime.
- **Usage**: Perfect for **simple values** like form inputs, toggles, counters.

**Example: Counter App**

- Increment count.
- Add **Decrement** button.
- Add **Reset** button (set count back to 0).

---

## useEffect: For Side Effects

- **Definition**: Lets you run code in response to state/lifecycle changes.
- **Side effects** = actions outside the componentâ€™s render (e.g., API calls, timers, subscriptions).
- **Analogy**: Reminder app â€” triggers alerts after specific events.

**Example: Fetching Data on Load**

- Fetch post when component loads.
- Add button â†’ fetch a **different post** using `useState`.
- Add input field â†’ fetch based on **post ID entered by user**.

## useContext: Managing Global State

- **Definition**: Shares state across multiple components without **prop drilling**.
- **Analogy**: Wi-Fi router â†’ connect once, access anywhere.
- **Usage**: Best for **themes, authentication, user preferences**, etc.

**Example: Theme Switcher**

- Switch between **light/dark theme**.
- Save theme in `localStorage` â†’ persist after refresh.
- Add **Reset button** â†’ reset theme to "light".

## Why State Management Hooks Matter

- **useState** â†’ for **isolated local state**.
- **useContext** â†’ for **shared global state**.
- **useReducer** (coming soon) â†’ for **complex, predictable state transitions**.

âš¡ Together, these can **replace Redux** in small to medium apps.

## Rules of Hooks (Important!)

1. Only call Hooks at the **top level** of your component (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions).
2. Only call Hooks from **React functions** (functional components or custom hooks).

- **useReducer** â†’ manage multiple state variables & actions
- **useMemo** â†’ cache derived values for performance
- **useCallback** â†’ prevent unnecessary re-renders with memoized functions

## Summary

- **React Hooks** = new foundation for state in modern React.
- **useState** â†’ Local state (counters, inputs, toggles).
- **useEffect** â†’ Side effects (API calls, timers, reactions to state).
- **useContext** â†’ Global state sharing (themes, auth, settings).
- Hooks make functional components **stateful, reusable, and optimized**.
