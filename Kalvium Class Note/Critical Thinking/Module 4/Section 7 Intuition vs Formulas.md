# Intuition vs Formulas – Notes

## 1. Introduction

- Humans often **trust intuition** (“gut feeling”) over algorithms.
- In many real-world scenarios, **simple formulas and algorithms outperform human judgment**.
- Examples: medicine, law, hiring, economic predictions.

## 2. The Apgar Score – Life-Saving Algorithm

- Created by **Dr. Virginia Apgar** to assess newborn health.
- **Five variables:** heart rate, respiration, reflex response, muscle tone, skin color.
- **Scoring:** 0, 1, 2 for each variable; total ≤4 → medical intervention needed.
- **Impact:** Standardized newborn assessment → reduced infant mortality worldwide.
- Demonstrates: simple, consistent algorithms can **save lives** and outperform subjective human judgment.

## 3. Algorithms vs Human Judgment

- **Paul Meehl’s research:** Compared expert predictions vs simple statistical formulas across 20 studies.
- **Findings:**
    - Formulas more accurate than humans in many cases (e.g., student performance, parole risk, pilot training).
    - ~60% of studies: algorithms outperform humans; remainder: tie.
- **Fields tested:** medicine, economics, law, sports, etc.
- Conclusion: **simple statistical rules are almost always more reliable than human intuition**.

## 4. Why Humans Resist Algorithms

1. **Belief in Human Expertise:** Trust personal experience and “subtle cues.”
2. **Complexity of Human Judgment:** Algorithms may miss emotional, contextual nuances.
3. **Moral and Emotional Concerns:** Preference for human care in consequential decisions.
4. **Natural Preference:** Humans trust other humans over machines.
5. **Fear of Algorithmic Errors:** Mistakes by algorithms feel more alarming than human errors.

- Kahneman quotes: algorithms criticized as “mechanical, artificial, blind,” while human judgment praised as “holistic, subtle, sensitive.”
- Emotional intensity and moral weight make people hesitant to rely solely on algorithms.

## 5. Key Takeaways

- **Algorithms are often superior:** Can incorporate patterns humans overlook, are consistent, and cheaper to apply.
- **Intuition is biased:** Humans overestimate their judgment accuracy.
- **Hostility towards algorithms** is emotional and moral, not purely rational.
- **Balanced approach:** Use algorithms as tools, with human supervision for ethical, emotional, or nuanced contexts.
