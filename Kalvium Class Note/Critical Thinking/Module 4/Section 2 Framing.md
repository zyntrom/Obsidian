# Framing Bias – Notes

## 1. Definition

- **Framing Bias**: A cognitive bias where people make decisions based on _how_ information is presented (framed), not on the actual facts.
- Example:
    - “90% fat free” vs “Contains 10% fat” → both mean the same, but most people choose “90% fat free.”

---

## 2. How It Works

- Our **System 1 thinking** (fast, instinctive) is easily influenced by framing.
- Decisions are made based on _appearance_ rather than objective analysis.
- Positive framing (gain-focused) is more attractive than negative framing (loss-focused).

---

## 3. Reasons Behind Framing Bias

### a) **Loss Aversion** (Kahneman & Tversky – Prospect Theory)

- Losses feel more significant than equivalent gains.
- People prefer:
    - A **sure gain** over a probable one.
    - A **probable loss** over a sure loss.
- Framing highlights gain/loss certainty → strongly influences choices.

---

### b) **Heuristics (Mental Shortcuts)**

1. **Availability Heuristic**
    - We rely on information that comes to mind quickly and easily.
    - Older adults (with limited cognitive resources) show stronger framing effects.
    - Options framed clearly and simply are more likely to be chosen.
2. **Affect Heuristic**
    - Decisions are influenced by emotional state instead of rational analysis.
    - Framing often uses **emotional appeals**.
    - Example: A politician’s **emotional speech** vs a dull factual report → same content, different impact.

---

## 4. Impact on Decision-Making

- We are swayed by **presentation style** instead of facts.
- Example: Choosing “90% fat free” over “10% fat” is not logical but instinctive.
- Shows reliance on mental shortcuts instead of deeper **System 2 thinking** (slow, logical).

---

## 5. Risks

- Companies, advertisers, and institutions exploit framing to manipulate decisions for profit.
- If unaware, people may make harmful or irrational decisions.

---

## 6. How to Avoid Framing Bias

- Step back and **analyze facts objectively**.
- Ask: _Am I judging based on how it sounds or on what it actually means?_
- Use **System 2 thinking** (deliberate, logical) instead of instinctive reactions.
- Awareness = protection from manipulation.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

- Framing = same fact, different presentation → different choices.
- Driven by **loss aversion**, **availability heuristic**, and **affect heuristic**.
- Exploited in marketing, politics, and decision-making.
- Awareness helps avoid being swayed and promotes rational decisions.
