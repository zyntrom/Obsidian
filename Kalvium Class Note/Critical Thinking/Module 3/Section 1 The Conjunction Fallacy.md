# Cognitive Biases – The Conjunction Fallacy

## 🔹 Definition

- **Conjunction Fallacy:** The mistaken belief that **two events occurring together (A ∧ B)** is more likely than just one of them occurring (A).
- Violates **basic probability law**:  
    P(A ∧ B) ≤ P(A) and P(A ∧ B) ≤ P(B)

## 🔹 Classic Examples

### 1. Lucy Problem

- Q: Which is more likely?  
    A. Lucy is a portrait artist  
    B. Lucy is a portrait artist who also plays poker
- Many choose **B** (more detailed) → But logically, **A is more probable**.

### 2. The Linda Problem (Kahneman & Tversky)

- Description: Linda, 31, single, outspoken, bright, studied philosophy, concerned with social justice.
- Options (simplified):
    - A: Linda is a bank teller
    - B: Linda is a bank teller **and** active in feminist movement
- **Result:** 85–90% chose **B** (more detailed but less probable).
- **Error:** Being both (bank teller ∧ feminist) is a **subset** of just being a bank teller.

### 3. More Examples

- **Heather:**
    - A: Has a PhD
    - B: Has a PhD **and** owns a dog  
        → Correct: **A**
- **Running:**
    - A: Get bitten by a dog
    - B: Get bitten by someone’s pet dog  
        → Correct: **A**
- **Karen:**
    - A: Woman
    - B: Mom  
        → Correct: **A** (all moms are women, but not all women are moms).

## 🔹 Why Does It Happen?

- **System 1 (fast, intuitive):**
    
    - Loves detail-rich, coherent stories.
        
    - Quickly judges "representativeness."
        
- **System 2 (slow, logical):**
    
    - Should apply probability rules (Venn diagrams).
        
    - But often “lazy” and not triggered.
        
- Outcome → System 1 overrides logic → Fallacy occurs.

## 🔹 Visualization Example (Kahneman’s Health Survey)

- **Group 1 (abstract phrasing):** Asked percentages of men with heart attacks vs. men >55 with heart attacks.
    
- **Group 2 (concrete sample of 100 men):** Same question framed with actual numbers.
    
- **Finding:** Concrete visualization reduces error → people see subset relationships more clearly.

## 🔹 Key Takeaways

- **Conjunction fallacy = detail bias.**
    
- People wrongly think **specific + vivid stories** are more likely than general ones.
    
- To avoid it:
    
    - Trigger **System 2** thinking.
        
    - Use **probability rules** (subset logic).
        
    - Frame problems with **concrete numbers/visuals**.
