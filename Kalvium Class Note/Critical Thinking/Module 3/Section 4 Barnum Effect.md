## 3. Psychology Behind It

### 1. Subjective Validation

- We accept statements as true if they match what we already believe about ourselves.
- Example: _“You observe before speaking”_ feels accurate if that’s your self-image.

### 2. Pollyanna Principle

- Humans focus more on positive information than negative.
- Flattering statements are more easily accepted than critical ones.

## 5. Key Takeaways

- The Barnum Effect shows how easily we assign **personal meaning to vague statements**.
- It happens because of our need for **validation, positivity, and self-identity reinforcement**.
- By recognizing patterns (contrasting traits, flattering tone, etc.), we can think critically.
- Next time something feels “too accurate,” pause and ask:
    - Is this truly unique to me, or just cleverly phrased for everyone?
