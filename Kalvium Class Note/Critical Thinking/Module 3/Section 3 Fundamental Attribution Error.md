# Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)

## 1. What is FAE?

- **Definition**: The tendency to attribute others’ behavior to their personality (dispositional factors) while attributing our own behavior to the situation (situational factors).
    
- **Example**:
    
    - You are late due to a road closure → you blame the situation.
        
    - Another student is late due to a road closure → you assume they are careless or lazy.
        

This shows how we judge ourselves differently than we judge others.

## 2. Why it Happens

Research (Decision Lab, psychology studies) shows several reasons:

### a) Limited Mental Resources

- Explaining someone’s behavior accurately requires 3 steps:
    
    1. Categorize the behavior → _What are they doing?_
        
    2. Make a dispositional judgment → _What does it say about their personality?_
        
    3. Apply situational correction → _What external factors explain this?_
        
- Steps 1 and 2 are automatic. Step 3 requires deliberate effort.
    
- When tired, distracted, or rushed, we skip Step 3 → leading to FAE.

### b) Mood Effects

- **Good mood** → more likely to commit FAE (careless, shortcut-based thinking).
    
- **Bad mood** → less likely (more vigilant, systematic, attentive to details).
    
- Example: Happy participants recall fewer details of a situation than unhappy ones.

### c) Belief in “Highly Diagnostic” Behaviors

- Some behaviors are seen as _direct indicators_ of character.
    
- Example:
    
    - Stealing → assumed “evil person.”
        
    - Helping → not automatically assumed “saintly person.”
        
- When we see a behavior as diagnostic, we ignore situational factors.

## 3. How to Avoid FAE

### a) Practice Empathy

- Put yourself in the other person’s shoes.
    
- Imagine how _you’d_ want to be judged in the same situation.
    

### b) Build Emotional Intelligence (EI)

- EI includes empathy, self-awareness, and self-regulation.
    
- Can be developed through:
    
    - Journaling
        
    - Reflection
        
    - Courses on EI
        

### c) Focus on Positives

- Remember people are complex (good + bad traits).
    
- A single action does not define someone’s entire character.

## 4. Key Takeaways

- **FAE = judging others by character but ourselves by circumstance.**
    
- It happens because situational corrections are skipped, moods influence thinking, and some behaviors are seen as character-defining.
    
- **Avoiding FAE** requires empathy, emotional intelligence, and balanced judgment.
