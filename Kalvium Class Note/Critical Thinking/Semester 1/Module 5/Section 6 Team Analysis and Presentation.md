## 📘 Your Task

### Apply These 5 Key **Critical Thinking Concepts:**

|Concept|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Confirmation Bias**|Tendency to notice or favor information that supports what we already believe.|Only reading articles that agree with your opinion about AI tools.|
|**2. Survivorship Bias**|Focusing only on successful cases while ignoring failures.|Thinking college dropouts always succeed because of a few famous ones.|
|**3. Framing Effect**|The way information is presented affects decisions.|Saying “90% pass rate” vs. “10% fail rate” changes perception.|
|**4. Anchoring Effect**|Relying too heavily on the first piece of information we hear.|The first salary number mentioned anchors future negotiation.|
|**5. Sunk Cost Fallacy**|Continuing a decision because of past investment, not future value.|Continuing a failing project just because you already spent money/time on it.|

## 🧠 How to Approach Your Topic

1. **Understand the Question**
    - Clarify what’s really being asked.
    - Avoid jumping to conclusions.
2. **Spot Biases and Assumptions**
    - Where might people’s thinking go wrong?
    - What hidden biases could influence decisions?
3. **Consider Multiple Perspectives**
    - What would different groups (students, teachers, parents, etc.) think?
    - Is there a middle ground or compromise?
4. **Use Logical Reasoning and Evidence**
    - Support your points with real examples, data, or analogies.
    - Avoid emotional or one-sided reasoning.
5. **Prepare a Clear Presentation**
    - 3–5 slides → Simple, logical, and visual.
    - One idea per slide (Introduction → Analysis → Conclusion).
    - End with a short **takeaway** or **recommendation**.

## 💬 Example Topics and Thinking Directions

|Topic|Key Questions|Biases to Watch|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Gap year before college**|Does a gap year help or delay career progress?|Survivorship bias (only hearing success stories), Sunk cost (feeling “wasted time”).|
|**2. Likes & views on social media**|Do they affect what we believe is true or important?|Confirmation bias, Framing effect.|
|**3. Personality tests for leadership**|Are these fair measures of leadership potential?|Anchoring (test score = ability), Framing (how results are presented).|
|**4. Using AI tools like ChatGPT**|Should students use AI in assignments?|Confirmation bias, Framing effect, Sunk cost (teachers resisting change).|
