## 🧠 Lesson 5.3 — Bad Events

### 🌪️ Key Idea:

Humans react **faster and more strongly to negative events** than to positive ones.  
This is called the **Negativity Bias** — _“Bad is stronger than good.”_

---

## ⚡ Reacting to Threats (Brain & Emotion)

- When people saw **fearful eyes** for less than 2/100 of a second:
    - They didn’t consciously register it.
    - But their **amygdala** (emotion center in the brain) still **lit up** — signaling danger.
- 🧩 This happens because:
    - The information **bypasses the visual cortex** (conscious seeing).
    - It takes a **shortcut** to the **amygdala**, allowing **instant reactions**.

### 🦁 Why This Exists:

- Evolutionary survival mechanism — detecting threats quickly = higher chance of survival.
- Angry or threatening faces “pop out” faster than happy ones.
- ⚡ **System 1 Thinking:** Automatic, fast, instinctive (reacts to danger instantly).

> No equally fast system exists for recognizing good news.

## 💔 Loss Aversion ≠ The Whole Story

- **Prospect Theory:** People fear **losses** more than they value **gains**.
- But **Loss Aversion** is just one part of a bigger truth:  
    👉 **Negativity dominates positivity.**

### Examples:

- Negative feedback hurts more than positive feels good.
- One cockroach ruins a bowl of candy. One candy doesn’t fix a bowl of cockroaches.

### Pattern:

> In most cases, **negative > positive** in emotional impact.

## 📘 “Bad Is Stronger Than Good” (Research Summary)

Scholars found that:

- Bad emotions, events, and feedback affect us **more deeply** than good ones.
- Bad impressions and stereotypes form **faster** and are **harder to change**.
- We work harder to **avoid bad self-images** than to **build good ones**.

## 🧩 Decision-Making and Negativity Bias

(Source: _The Decision Lab_)

### How Negativity Bias Affects Us:

- We **focus more on negative memories**, shaping future decisions.
- It can lead to **poor reasoning** or **over-cautious decisions**.

### Impact on Self-Esteem:

- Study (Müller-Pinzler et al.) — LOOP task:
    
    - People **updated beliefs negatively** about themselves after feedback.
    - But treated others’ feedback **equally** (positive and negative).
- This can cause **low confidence** and **anxiety** if unchecked.

> ⚠️ Over-focusing on negatives harms performance and self-image.

## ⚖️ Defending the Status Quo

- Losses are felt **relative to the current state (status quo)**.
- People resist changes that **reduce** what they already have.

### Example:

- Getting ₹50 feels good.
- But getting ₹100 and then losing ₹50 feels like a **loss**, even though you still gain ₹50.  
    → Because your **reference point** shifted.

### Fairness and Status Quo:

- People find actions that **reduce** their current benefits **unfair**.
- Cutting current workers’ pay feels **unfair**,  
    but paying new workers less feels **fair** — since it doesn’t reduce anyone’s status quo.

## 💬 Core Takeaways

1. The **amygdala** reacts to threats before conscious thought — evolution’s way to keep us safe.
2. **Negative events** and emotions are **processed faster and deeper** than positive ones.
3. **Negativity Bias** affects:
    - Decision-making
    - Self-esteem
    - Perception of fairness
4. Humans defend the **status quo** to avoid the pain of losses.
5. “Bad is stronger than good” — the human mind is wired to **focus on negatives** for survival.
