## 🧠 Lesson 5.4 — The Fourfold Pattern

### 🌟 Key Idea:

Human decisions are **not purely logical** — we **overweight unlikely events** and **underweight near certainties**.  
This pattern of how we perceive **risk and probability** is known as the **Fourfold Pattern** in **Prospect Theory** (Kahneman & Tversky).

## 🎲 The Allais Paradox — The Starting Point

### Problem A:

- 61% chance to win $520,000
- 63% chance to win $500,000  
    → Most people pick **61% chance to win $520,000**

### Problem B:

- 98% chance to win $520,000
- 100% chance to win $500,000  
    → Most people pick **100% chance to win $500,000**

⚠️ This is **illogical** because your preference flips even though both choices were improved versions of each other.

### Why This Happens:

- The **2% difference** feels much larger when it’s **between 100% and 98%** (certainty effect).
- The jump from “almost certain” to “certain” carries **psychological weight** much greater than its actual probability.

## 💫 Possibility & Certainty Effects

|Effect|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Possibility Effect**|Small probabilities are **overweighted**; people give them more importance than they deserve.|Buying a **lottery ticket** for a tiny chance to win big.|
|**Certainty Effect**|People overvalue **100% certainty** compared to near certainty.|Preferring **guaranteed ₹500** over a 98% chance to win ₹520.|

### Example:

Improving your chance to win $1M:

- From **0% → 5%** feels _amazing_ (you now have a chance!)
- From **5% → 10%** doesn’t feel twice as good  
    👉 The **first improvement** feels larger than it really is — **Possibility Effect**.

## 🧩 Prospect Theory & Decision Weights

- People attach **decision weights** to outcomes, not just probabilities.
- These weights are **distorted versions** of real probabilities.

|Actual Probability|Perceived Weight|Bias Type|
|---|---|---|
|Very low (2%)|Overvalued (~8%)|Possibility Effect|
|Very high (98%)|Undervalued (~87%)|Certainty Effect|

So, our mind’s “probability curve” is **not straight** — it bends!

## 🧮 The Fourfold Pattern of Risk Preferences

|Probability|Outcome Type|Behavior|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|**High chance of gain**|Gain|**Risk-averse**|Taking a sure ₹500 instead of 95% chance to win ₹600|
|**Low chance of gain**|Gain|**Risk-seeking**|Buying lottery tickets (tiny chance, big win)|
|**High chance of loss**|Loss|**Risk-seeking**|Gambling to avoid a sure big loss|
|**Low chance of loss**|Loss|**Risk-averse**|Buying insurance (small chance of disaster)|

---

## 🧠 Why These Happen

### 1. **Diminishing Sensitivity**

- The emotional difference between ₹0 and ₹100 feels larger than between ₹900 and ₹1000.
- So we react more strongly to the **first change** than later ones.

### 2. **Distorted Decision Weights**

- A 90% chance feels like **71%** in our minds → we **underestimate** near certainties.

## 💥 Real-Life Examples of the Fourfold Pattern

### 1. **Lotteries (Bottom Left Cell)**

- Small chance of huge gain → **possibility effect**
- People overpay for the “dream” of winning.

### 2. **Insurance (Bottom Right Cell)**

- Small chance of huge loss → **risk aversion**
- People overpay for **peace of mind**.

### 3. **Desperate Gambles (Top Right Cell)**

- High chance of big loss → **risk seeking**
- People take desperate risks to **avoid sure defeat**
    - Businesses continue investing in failing tech.
    - Armies fight hopeless wars instead of surrendering.

### 4. **Safe Choices (Top Left Cell)**

- High chance of big gain → **risk aversion**
- Prefer guaranteed reward over slightly better gamble.

## ⚖️ Legal Example — Plaintiffs & Defendants

|Role|Situation|Fourfold Cell|Behavior|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Plaintiff**|95% chance of winning large damages|**Top Left** (high chance of gain)|Risk-averse → prefers guaranteed settlement|
|**Defendant**|95% chance of losing large damages|**Top Right** (high chance of loss)|Risk-seeking → prefers to gamble in court|

📌 Result:  
Defendants often have a **stronger bargaining position**, leading plaintiffs to **settle for less**.

---

## 🏙️ Kahneman’s Example — City of New York

- 200 lawsuits per year
- Each: 5% chance to cost $1 million
- Can settle all for $100,000 each

### Options:

- **Litigate all** → expected loss = $10M
- **Settle all** → total loss = $20M

👉 Playing it “safe” (settling) actually **costs more in the long run**.

**Lesson:**  
Overweighting small risks or underweighting high probabilities leads to **bad long-term results**.

## 💬 Core Takeaways

1. Humans **don’t process probability rationally** — emotions distort it.
2. We **overreact** to small chances of big outcomes (lottery, fear).
3. We **underreact** to near certainties (almost sure outcomes).
4. We **fear losses** more than we **value gains**.
5. **Fourfold pattern** explains our inconsistent risk behaviors in gains and losses.
6. Smart decisions = pause, think, **check the actual probabilities**.
