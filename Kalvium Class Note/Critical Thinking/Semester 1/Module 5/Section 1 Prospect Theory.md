# Prospect Theory – Notes

## 1. Introduction

- Classical economic theory (Expected Utility Theory) assumes people evaluate gains and losses symmetrically.
- Real-world behavior contradicts this → people **avoid risk with gains** but **seek risk with losses**.
- Developed by **Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky** to explain actual human decision-making under risk.

## 2. Key Observations

- Scenario 1 (Gain): Most choose **sure $900** over 90% chance to win $1,000 → **rishik-averse**.
- Scenario 2 (Loss): Most choose 90% chance to lose $1,000 over **sure loss $900** → **risk-seeking**.
- Patterns show that **perception of gains/losses** is relative, not absolute.

## 3. Core Concepts of Prospect Theory

### a) Reference Points

- Outcomes are evaluated **relative to a reference point** (status quo or expectation).
- Example: $1,000 bonus expected $2,000 → feels like a **loss**; expected $0 → feels like a **gain**.

### b) Loss Aversion

- **Losses hurt more than equivalent gains feel good**.
- Psychological impact: Losing $100 > Gaining $100.
- Explains risk-averse behavior for gains and risk-seeking behavior for losses.

### c) Diminishing Sensitivity

- Subjective impact **reduces with magnitude**.
- Example: Difference between $100 → $200 feels bigger than $1,100 → $1,200, though both are $100 difference.

## 4. Implications of Prospect Theory

- Humans:
    1. **Risk-averse for gains**, risk-seeking for losses.
    2. Influenced by **framing of choices**.
    3. Don’t always act in purely rational/self-interest.
- Explains behavior beyond economics: finance, personal life, professional decisions.
- Highlights **System 1 thinking biases**: emotions and perception override logical calculation.

## 5. Takeaways

1. Always identify your **reference point** before making decisions.
2. Recognize **loss aversion** in yourself to avoid unnecessary risk-seeking.
3. Consider **framing effects**: how a choice is presented influences your decision.
4. Awareness of biases → **better, more self-aware decision-making**.
