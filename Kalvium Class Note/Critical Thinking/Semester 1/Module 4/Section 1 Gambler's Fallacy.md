# Gambler’s Fallacy – Notes

## 1. Definition

- **Gambler’s Fallacy**: A cognitive bias / thinking error where people believe that if an independent event occurs multiple times, it reduces the chance of it happening again.
- **Example**: Believing that after 3 consecutive heads, the next coin toss is “more likely” to be tails.

## 2. Key Concepts

- **Independent events**: Each coin flip has a 50% chance of heads or tails, regardless of previous outcomes.
- **Coin has no memory** → Past outcomes do not influence future ones.
- **Every sequence is equally likely**:
    - Getting HHHHH is just as likely as HTTHH or THTHT.
- **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**:
    - As the number of trials increases, results converge toward the expected probability (e.g., 50-50 for heads/tails).
    - Applies to **large samples**, not individual or small samples.
    - Example: 6 flips ≠ representative of probability, 100 flips ≈ closer to 50-50.

## 3. Misconceptions Leading to Gambler’s Fallacy

1. **Rare sequences misconception**
    - People think HHHHH is “special” or rarer than HTHTH.
    - Reality: Each sequence has the same probability.
2. **Probability misinterpretation**
    - Believing 50% means exactly half outcomes in small samples (e.g., 3 out of 6).
    - Reality: Small samples rarely represent actual distribution.
3. **Law of Small Numbers**
    - Mistaken belief that a small sample reflects the larger population.
    - Psychologists Tversky & Kahneman → “insensitivity to sample size.”
4. **Representativeness Heuristic**
    - People judge likelihood by similarity to past patterns or “ideal” outcomes.
    - Example: After many wins, gamblers expect a loss to “balance out.”
5. **Faith in chance as self-correcting**
    - Belief that chance restores balance automatically.
    - Example: A student avoids choosing the same MCQ option too many times in a row.
6. **Pattern perception bias**
    - Humans perceive order in randomness.
    - Example: HHHHH “looks special,” but it is no less likely than any other exact sequence.

## 4. Law of Large Numbers (LLN) Clarification

- States that with **many trials**, results converge on expected probability.
- **Wrong interpretation**: Believing probability “corrects itself” in the _next trial_.
- **Correct interpretation**: Only in the long run does the ratio of outcomes approximate expected probability.
- Example: If only 30% of flips are heads after 10 tries, the next flip is still 50% heads, not higher.

## 5. Why Does This Bias Occur?

- **Discomfort with randomness** → humans prefer order/predictability.
- **Heuristics (mental shortcuts)** → quick decisions without full reasoning.
- **Narrative-making** → assigning patterns to random events for sense-making.

## 6. Real-Life Examples

- Slot machine gambler expecting a loss after wins.
- Student changing MCQ answers due to repeating same option.
- Belief that “too many” heads means tails are “due.”

## 7. Key Takeaways

- Each independent event (like a coin flip) = same probability as before.
- Gambler’s Fallacy = misbelief that outcomes will “balance out” in the short term.
- LLN applies to **large numbers of trials**, not individual or small samples.
- Our brains:
    - Seek patterns in randomness.
    - Misinterpret chance as fair/self-correcting.
    - Use small samples as representatives of large populations.
