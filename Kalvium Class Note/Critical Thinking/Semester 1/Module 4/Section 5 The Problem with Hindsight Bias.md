# Hindsight Bias – Notes

## 1. Definition

- **Hindsight Bias:** The tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that the outcome was **predictable or obvious all along** (“I knew it all along”).
- Influences **System 1 thinking**: makes the world seem more **tidy, coherent, and predictable** than it really is.

## 2. Related Concepts

### a) Narrative Fallacy

- Our tendency to turn events into a **linear story**: cause → effect → outcome.
- Simplifies complexity and ignores the role of **luck** or unforeseen events.
- Example: Google’s rise seems like flawless decisions, but luck played a big role.

### b) WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)

- We create explanations based on **limited information**, assuming it’s all we need to know.
- Easier to make coherent stories with **less information**, which can reinforce hindsight bias.

### c) Premonition / Illusion of Knowledge

- People claim they “knew” something (e.g., 2008 financial crisis) **after the fact**, even if it wasn’t truly predictable.
- Misuse of “knowledge” reinforces the illusion that the world is predictable.

## 3. Causes of Hindsight Bias

- **Need for Coherence:** System 1 prefers tidy, simple narratives.
- **Overconfidence:** Belief that past events can predict the future.
- **Narrative Construction:** Ignoring randomness and unforeseen factors.
- **Outcome Knowledge:** Knowing the result distorts perception of prior uncertainty.

## 4. Effects / Consequences

### a) Distorted Judgment

- People judge decisions based on outcomes, not the **quality of the process**.
- Example: A surgeon’s low-risk operation results in death → jury thinks it was obviously risky.

### b) Overestimating Predictability

- Belief that future events are **more predictable** than they actually are.

### c) Harsher Criticism of Others

- Decision-makers are blamed for **not predicting unpredictable events**.
- Successes seem “obvious” in retrospect, minimizing skill or effort.

### d) Illusion of Learning

- We think we’ve learned from past events, ignoring **luck, complexity, and uncertainty**.

## 5. How to Mitigate Hindsight Bias

- **Focus on Process, Not Outcome:** Evaluate decisions based on reasoning, not results.
- **Acknowledge Uncertainty:** Accept that outcomes are influenced by randomness and incomplete information.
- **Avoid Oversimplified Narratives:** Consider alternative possibilities and what might have gone differently.
- **Language Awareness:** Avoid saying “I knew it all along”; describe what was **truly known beforehand**.

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Hindsight bias makes the past **look more predictable** than it really was.
- It affects both **self-perception** and **judgment of others**.
- Narrative fallacies and limited information exacerbate the bias.
- Clear thinking requires **separating outcome knowledge from decision quality**.
