# Better-than-Average Bias – Notes

## 1. Definition

- **Better-than-Average Bias (Illusory Superiority):**  
    A cognitive bias where individuals **overestimate their own qualities and abilities** compared to others.
- Example:
    - In a room of 100 drivers, most claim they are “above average” drivers → mathematically impossible.

## 2. Why It Happens

### a) **Self-Esteem Motive**
- Humans have a deep need to maintain **self-worth and confidence**.
- Believing we are better than others preserves self-esteem, even if evidence suggests otherwise.

### b) **Selective Comparison**
- We compare ourselves to those who are **less skilled** → makes us look superior.
- Example: If your family bowls poorly, you’ll feel “great” at bowling—until you compare yourself to professional players.

### c) **Lack of Self-Awareness**
- Many people lack accurate **self-assessment skills**.
- Example: Thinking you aced a test but scoring poorly.
- Society rarely emphasizes self-awareness as a critical skill → leads to **overestimation of ability**.

## 3. Dunning–Kruger Effect
- A specific consequence of **lack of self-awareness**.
- People with **low ability** in a subject:
    - Lack knowledge about its complexity.
    - Therefore **overestimate their competence**.
- Named after psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger.
- Example: A beginner in chess thinking they can “easily beat advanced players” without realizing the depth of skill required.

## 4. Psychological Insights

- Opposite of “better-than-average bias” is seen in **depressive realism**:
    - People with depression often assess themselves **more realistically**.
    - However, this can feel unpleasant because reality is harsher than illusions of superiority.

---

## 5. Impact on Decision-Making

- Leads to **overconfidence** in skills, judgments, and abilities.
- May cause poor choices, mistakes, or under-preparation.
- Can harm growth because **acknowledging weaknesses is necessary for improvement**.

---

## 6. Ways to Reduce Bias

- **Seek external feedback** (from peers, mentors).
- Practice **self-awareness and self-reflection**.
- Compare yourself realistically to a **wider pool** (not just weaker individuals).
- Stay open to learning and recognize the complexity of skills.
