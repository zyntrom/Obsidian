# When to Trust Expert Intuition – Notes

## 1. Introduction

- Kahneman (intuition often flawed) vs. Klein (intuition in real-world experts is reliable).
- Adversarial collaboration: Goal → understand **when expert intuition works**.

## 2. What Is Intuition?

- **Definition (Herbert Simon):**
    > “The situation provides a cue; this cue gives the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer.”
- Intuition = **pattern recognition + learning from experience**.
- Example: Firefighter sensing danger, driver avoiding a risky turn (learned experience).

## 3. Recognition Primed Model (RPD) – Klein

- Experts generate **one plausible option** from experience.
- Mentally simulate it:
    - If workable → implement.
    - If not → modify or move to next option.
- **System 1:** generates tentative plan (fast, automatic).
- **System 2:** checks and simulates plan (deliberate, slow).

## 4. Intuition in Practice

- Reliable **only in environments that are:**
    1. **Regular** → patterns exist.
    2. **Predictable** → feedback is clear and immediate.
- Examples of high-validity domains: chess, bridge, poker, firefighting, medicine, nursing.
- Low-validity domains: stock picking, political forecasting → intuition often fails.

## 5. Expert Intuition vs Pseudo-Expert Intuition

- **Expert intuition:**
    - Years of experience in predictable, feedback-rich environments.
    - Can make accurate **short-term decisions**.
- **Pseudo-expert intuition:**
    - Overconfidence in chaotic or low-validity situations.
    - Leads to errors due to **illusion of validity** and cognitive biases.
    - Example: stock market predictions, long-term forecasts.

## 6. Cognitive Biases & Intuition

- **Illusion of validity:** Overestimating accuracy of judgment.
- **Cognitive ease:** Information that is easy to process feels true → false sense of coherence.
- **Overconfidence:** Pseudo-experts ignore limits of knowledge → prone to mistakes.

## 7. Key Takeaways

1. Intuition = learned pattern recognition, **not magic**.
2. **Trust intuition only when:**
    - Environment is stable and predictable.
    - Feedback is clear and immediate.
    - Expert has sufficient experience in that domain.
3. **Avoid relying on intuition when:**
    - Environment is chaotic or low-validity.
    - Feedback is delayed or ambiguous.
    - Overconfidence is high → risk of pseudo-expert mistakes.
4. True expertise = **knowing when to trust intuition and when to pause and analyze**.

✅ **Exam Tip:**

- Example question: _“Explain the conditions under which expert intuition is reliable. Contrast with pseudo-expert intuition and illustrate using Kahneman & Klein’s findings.”_
