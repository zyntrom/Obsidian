# Illusion of Validity – Notes

## 1. Definition

- **Illusion of Validity:** The tendency to **overestimate the accuracy of our judgments or predictions**, especially when we feel confident.
- Confidence is **mistaken for correctness**, even when evidence shows predictions are often wrong.
- Rooted in **System 1 thinking**: we trust intuitive judgments without checking accuracy.

## 2. How It Occurs

### a) Simplified Story-Making

- People create narratives to make sense of events.
- Less information → easier to make coherent stories → feel confident in conclusions.
- Overconfidence arises because the story **fits smoothly**, not because it’s true.

### b) Misattribution of Skill

- Success is often attributed to skill rather than **luck or uncontrollable factors**.
- Example: Google’s rise is often seen as skill-driven, ignoring luck and chance.

### c) Examples in Education

- Teachers predicting student performance based on past grades may be **misled by unknown factors** like personal issues.

### d) Financial Markets

- Investors often believe they have special stock-picking skills.
- Studies show: most perform **no better than random chance** over time.
- Overconfidence persists due to culture and reinforcing community beliefs.
- Men tend to overtrade more than women, often performing worse.

## 3. Causes

- **Ease of Information Processing:** Confidence grows when information forms a coherent story.
- **System 1 Thinking:** Quick judgments feel valid even without evidence.
- **Confirmation Bias:** Evidence supporting the story reinforces perceived accuracy.
- **Cultural Reinforcement:** Communities or industries amplify belief in personal skill (e.g., Wall Street).

## 4. Effects / Consequences

- Overestimation of personal judgment accuracy.
- Poor decision-making in **finance, education, and leadership**.
- Ignoring the role of **luck and randomness**.
- Resistance to feedback or evidence that contradicts confident predictions.

---

## 5. Mitigation Strategies

- **Focus on Evidence, Not Intuition:** Evaluate predictions based on track records and statistical data.
- **Challenge Confidence:** Ask whether confidence is justified or just feels right.
- **Consider Luck & Randomness:** Recognize outcomes are influenced by factors beyond control.
- **Seek Diverse Opinions:** Feedback from others can reveal blind spots in judgment.
- **Separate Skill from Outcome:** Success does not always prove skill; failure does not always prove incompetence.

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Confidence ≠ accuracy.
- The illusion of validity is a **systematic overestimation of predictive ability**.
- Common in **investing, education, and everyday decision-making**.
- Awareness and evidence-based thinking are crucial to avoid its pitfalls.
