## Ego Depletion

Letâ€™s start with a powerful idea: the human brain is like a power unit. And like any power unit, it hasÂ **limited capacity**â€”especially when it comes to mental energy. To preserve this energy, your brain often tries to conserve effort whenever possible.

### What is Ego Depletion?

**Ego depletion**Â refers to theÂ **draining of mental energy**Â required to resist base impulses and make conscious decisions. Whether you're resisting that gooey cheese pizza or solving a complex math problem, your brainâ€™s self-control reserves are getting used up.

And once that mental energy is depleted? Youâ€™re more likely to give in to temptation, make errors, and rely on quick, automatic thinking.

### The Hungry Judge Effect

So how serious is ego depletion? Serious enough to affect people in positions of powerâ€”likeÂ **judges**.
Even something as simple as hunger can tip the scales in major legal decisions!

## The Lazy System

This brings us to a big insight: ðŸ§ Â **The mind is a lazy system.**

Itâ€™s always trying toÂ **save energy**â€”and often takes shortcuts unless absolutely necessary. When weâ€™re mentally exhausted,Â **System 2 (the analytical part of the mind)**Â goes off-duty, and quick, automatic decisions fromÂ **System 1**Â take over.

When weâ€™re mentally tired, these kinds of errors happen more frequently. System 2 is the gatekeeper that prevents faulty logicâ€”but only when it has energy left.

## Willpower and the Mind

### Why Does This Matter?

BecauseÂ **willpower can be trained.**Â Every time you resist a distraction or temptation, youâ€™re building that self-control muscle.
## Cognitive Ease

YourÂ **System 1**Â runs all these checks automaticallyâ€”and decides whether or not to engageÂ **System 2**.

Think of your mind working in two extreme states:

- **Easy:**Â Everything feels smooth. You're relaxed, trust your intuition, and go with the flow.
- **Strained:**Â A problem shows up. System 2 kicks in, you focus harder, analyze more, and think critically.

When youâ€™re inÂ **cognitive ease**, you're:

- Happy
- Relaxed
- Likely to believe what you hear
- Less likely to question information

But when you're underÂ **strain**, you're:

- Alert and suspicious
- More analytical
- Less prone to errorsâ€”but also less intuitive
