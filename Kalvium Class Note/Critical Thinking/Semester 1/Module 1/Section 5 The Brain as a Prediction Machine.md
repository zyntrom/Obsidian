## ✅ **Summary**

The brain doesn’t just passively receive information — it actively **predicts** what’s happening based on past experiences. This predictive nature helps us navigate the world efficiently but can also lead to **errors in perception** and **judgement**, especially when we rely too much on **System 1** thinking (fast and intuitive). Recognizing when to switch to **System 2** (slow and analytical) is essential for better problem-solving and decision-making.

## 🧠 Key Notes: The Predictive Brain & Perception

### 🟡 **The Dress Illusion**

- People saw the same photo differently (white/gold vs black/blue).
- This wasn't about eyesight, but **how the brain interprets ambiguous sensory input**.
- Brain fills in gaps based on **assumptions and context**.

---

### 🔵 **Prediction: A Survival Tool**

- The brain constantly builds a **model of the world** to predict outcomes.
- Example: Predicting a falling bag from an overhead rack.
- Helps avoid danger through instinctive correction or prevention.

---

### 🌟 **Filling in the Gaps**

- Example: “Twinkle twinkle little…” → Brain predicts “star”.
- Shows how the brain uses **pattern recognition** to complete familiar phrases or expectations.

---

### 🤭 **Tickling & Illusions**

- Even without touch, ticklish people react — showing how **expectation triggers response**.
- Rubber Hand Illusion: Brain’s model makes people **feel pain** in a fake hand.
- Shows that **perception is constructed**, not always real.

---

### 🔴 **Limits of Prediction**

- The predictive brain evolved to **keep us safe in threatening environments**.
- In modern, safer settings, it can lead to **biases and incorrect conclusions**.
- Our brains might still “jump to conclusions” inappropriately.

## 🧠 System 1 vs System 2 Thinking

|System|Description|Role in Prediction|
|---|---|---|
|System 1|Fast, automatic, emotional|Makes quick predictions based on past experience. Useful but error-prone.|
|System 2|Slow, logical, deliberate|Can override System 1, analyze more deeply, and reduce errors.|

- **Predictive brain mostly operates in System 1**.
- But for better judgment and problem-solving, **System 2 must be engaged**.

---

## 📝 Conclusion

- The brain’s **predictive nature** is powerful and efficient but not always accurate.
- **Awareness of prediction errors** and using **System 2 thinking** can improve decision-making.
- Balance intuition with analysis to avoid biases and perception errors.
