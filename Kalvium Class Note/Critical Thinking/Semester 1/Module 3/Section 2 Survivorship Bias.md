# Cognitive Biases – Survivorship Bias

## 🔹 Definition

- **Survivorship Bias:** A cognitive bias where we focus only on **visible successes** while ignoring the **invisible failures**.
- Leads to **overestimating success rates** and making flawed conclusions.
- Example: “Drop out of college like Steve Jobs → you’ll succeed” ignores countless dropouts who failed.

---

## 🔹 Core Problem

- Survivorship bias = **incomplete dataset**.
- We only see the **survivors**, not the failures.
- Creates an **illusion of patterns** that may not exist.

Example:

- Studying only successful YouTubers → miss thousands who tried the same strategies but failed.
- Asking only parachutists who landed safely if the sport is safe → ignores those who died.

## 🔹 Real-World Examples

### 1. Startups & Entrepreneurship

- Motivational focus on billionaire founders.
- Hidden reality: thousands failed with similar strategies.
- Misleads about **true risk of failure**.

---

### 2. Investing

- Poorly performing mutual funds are closed/merged.
- Only surviving funds are shown → **returns look inflated**.
- Like grading a class by ignoring dropouts.

---

### 3. Scientific Research

- **Publication bias:** Successful/positive studies published, failures not.
- Skews understanding of what’s true.

---

### 4. Personal Development / Self-Help

- “Successful people wake up at 5 AM / journal daily.”
- Ignores all who did the same but failed.
- Creates false **cause-and-effect illusion**.

---

### 5. Historical Example – WWII Bombers

- U.S. military studied returning bombers to decide where to add armor.
- Bullet holes: wings & tail (visible damage).
- Statistician **Abraham Wald**: Planes hit in engines/cockpit didn’t return → that’s where reinforcement was needed.

- Lesson: Don’t just study survivors → study what’s **missing**.

## 🔹 How to Recognize Survivorship Bias?

Ask:

- What data is missing?
- Are we only seeing survivors?
- What would the **complete dataset** look like?
- Are we mistaking **outliers** for general rules?
- Is the story hiding failures that matter?

---

## 🔹 How to Avoid Being Misled?

1. **Study failures** → they show what _not_ to do.
2. **Check base rates** → actual frequency of success.
3. **Question simple stories** → success rarely has one cause.
4. **Look for hidden factors** → what explains why others failed?

---

## 🔹 Key Takeaways

- Survivorship bias = **seeing winners only**.
- Success stories inspire, but they **distort reality** if failures are ignored.
- Critical thinking = ask about **unseen evidence**.
- For every Steve Jobs, there are thousands of forgotten failures.
- **Visibility ≠ probability.**
