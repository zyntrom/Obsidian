# Loss Aversion

## 1. Definition

- **Loss Aversion** = the tendency to feel losses **more deeply** than equivalent gains.
- Example: Losing ₹100 hurts more than the joy of gaining ₹100.
- Introduced by **Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky** in **Prospect Theory**.
- People prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains, even when the odds are equal.

## 2. Why Loss Aversion Happens

### a) Neurological Basis (Brain Regions)

1. **Amygdala** → processes fear → loss triggers anxiety & stress hormones (adrenaline, cortisol).
2. **Striatum** → calculates prediction errors → reacts more strongly to losses than gains.
3. **Insula** → linked to disgust → activates more strongly with potential losses.

→ Together, these create an **automatic fear of loss**.

### b) Socio-Economic Factors

- **Powerful people** → less loss averse (can handle losses due to resources/networks).
- **Wealthy people** → tolerate losses better, but effect depends on their social environment.
    - Wealthy in rich areas → less loss averse.
    - Wealthy in poor areas → more loss averse.
- **Social hierarchy** plays a role in risk perception.

### c) Cultural Factors

- **Collectivist cultures** (close-knit communities) → less loss averse (social support system).
- **Individualistic cultures** → more loss averse (lack of safety net).
- Studies: Eastern Europeans → most loss averse; Africans → least.

## 3. How Loss Aversion Affects Us

- **Daily Decisions** → prefer safe options, avoid risks.
- **Marketing Exploitation**:
    - Free trials, rebates, subscriptions → people buy to avoid losing access.
    - Scaling back (cars, houses, software) feels like loss → emotionally difficult.
- **Missed Opportunities** → Fear of loss prevents beneficial risks:
    - rejecting a new job,
    - not investing,
    - avoiding major life changes.

## 4. Connection with Other Biases

- **Sunk Cost Fallacy** → keep investing to avoid admitting loss.
- **Commitment Bias** → stick to poor decisions to avoid loss of effort/time.
- **Ego Depletion** → stress from losses weakens self-control, leading to worse choices.

## 5. Avoiding Loss Aversion

### 1. **Framing**

- How a choice is presented affects decisions.
- Emphasizing **gains** instead of **losses** reduces fear.
    - Example: “You’ll gain ₹50” vs “Don’t lose ₹50.”

### 2. **Putting Loss into Perspective**

- Ask: _“What is the worst-case scenario?”_
- Helps see that the loss may be small compared to the potential gain.
- Encourages rational, not fear-driven, decision-making.

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Loss aversion = **losses hurt more than gains feel good**.
- Driven by brain biology (amygdala, striatum, insula), social/wealth status, and culture.
- Exploited in **marketing** & affects **financial, ethical, and daily decisions**.
- Closely tied to **sunk cost fallacy & commitment bias**.
- Can be reduced using **framing** & **perspective-taking**.
- Recognizing it helps make **rational, opportunity-focused decisions**.
