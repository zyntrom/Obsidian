# Confirmation Bias

## 1. Definition

- **Confirmation bias** = the tendency to search for, notice, and give more weight to information that supports our pre-existing beliefs, while ignoring or downplaying evidence that contradicts them.
- It leads to _distorted judgment_ and _faulty decision-making_.

## 2. Example: Jane the Coffee Shop Manager

- Jane believes **“hard work = success.”**
- Sales drop → she assumes employees are not working hard.
- Evidence:
    - Notices long lunch breaks (supports her belief).
    - Ignores the real cause (bad store location).
- Result → wrong solution (longer hours, threats) + wasted money.
- **Cause**: She gave higher value to evidence fitting her belief and dismissed contradictory evidence.

## 3. Supporting Quote

- **Warren Buffett:**  
    _“What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.”_
- Meaning: We bend new information to protect our old beliefs instead of challenging them.

## 4. Why Does Confirmation Bias Happen?

### a) Cognitive Consistency

- Our brains face **information overload**.
- To manage it, we create **mental shortcuts & models** (heuristics).
- These help efficiency but also create blind spots.

### b) Selective Information Processing

- We recall and give importance to evidence supporting our worldview.
- Disconfirming data = ignored, doubted, or forgotten.

### c) Mental Energy Conservation

- Constantly questioning beliefs = mentally exhausting.
- Easier to strengthen existing beliefs than to revise them.

### d) Cognitive Dissonance Avoidance

- Holding contradictory ideas causes discomfort.
- To reduce this discomfort, we prefer focusing on one belief (our existing one).

## 5. Key Takeaways

- **Confirmation bias distorts reality** → we see what we want to see.
- It affects:
    - **Decision-making** (wrong conclusions, like Jane’s).
    - **Critical thinking** (less openness to new ideas).
    - **Memory** (recall biased toward confirmatory evidence).
- **Root cause**: human need for mental comfort, stability, and shortcuts.
