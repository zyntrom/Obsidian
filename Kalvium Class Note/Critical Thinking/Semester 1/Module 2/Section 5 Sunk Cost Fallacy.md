## ✅ **Topic: Sunk Cost Fallacy**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

> “Why do we keep going, even when it hurts?”

You're in a long queue, a course you hate, or a project that’s failing — and still, you stick with it. Why?  
Because you’ve already **invested time, effort, or money**, and **quitting now feels like waste**.  
This thinking trap is called the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**.

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define the **sunk cost fallacy** in your own words
- Understand the **psychological and emotional factors** behind it
- Identify it in your own **academic, social, or personal life**
- Learn how to **make smarter, present-focused decisions**

### ❓ **What is the Sunk Cost Fallacy?**

> The tendency to **continue a behavior or endeavor** based on **previous investments** (money, time, effort), even when it’s no longer the best choice.

Instead of asking:

- **“Is this still worth it?”**,  
    we ask:
- **“But I’ve already come this far!”**

#### 📌 Examples:

- Attending a course you dislike because it’s already paid for
- Staying in a club or team just because you’ve been there a long time
- Continuing with a failing group project to “save the work already done”

### 🧠 **Why Does It Happen?**

#### 1. **Loss Aversion**

- We hate **losing** more than we enjoy **winning**.
- Quitting feels like accepting a loss — even when continuing is worse.

#### 2. **Commitment Bias**

- Once we commit, we feel pressure to stay.
- Admitting a mistake feels harder than staying stuck.

#### 3. **Framing Effect**

- If you frame quitting as **failure**, you keep going.
- If you frame quitting as **making room for better**, you can let go.

#### 4. **Emotional Investment**

- We attach **pride, identity, and nostalgia** to what we’ve done.
- Letting go feels like leaving a part of ourselves behind.

#### 5. **Social Pressure**

- Fear of what **others will think** keeps us stuck — in jobs, majors, clubs, or relationships.
- We fear judgment more than wasted effort.

### 📊 **Real-World Examples**

#### 🏢 **Case Study 1: The Concorde Jet (UK & France)**

- Billions spent on a jet that was inefficient and unprofitable.
- Countries **kept funding it** just because they had **already spent so much**.
- Known as the "**Concorde Fallacy**."

#### 🎓 **Case Study 2: Ayesha’s Economics Course**

- Ayesha took a course due to peer influence.
- She didn’t enjoy it, but stayed because she had bought the books and told people.
- Result: **Burnout** and **unhappiness** — all to avoid “wasting effort.”

### 🧭 **Applying It to Your Life**

Think about moments when you’ve stayed with something:

- A course, job, project, or commitment
- Not because it made sense **now**, but because of how much effort you had already put in

#### 💬 Ask Yourself:

> “If I were making this decision for the first time today, with no history — what would I do?”

### 💡 **Final Insight**

The sunk cost fallacy tricks us into thinking that **quitting equals failure**.  
But sometimes, **letting go is the smartest thing you can do**.  
You are not defined by what you’ve invested — you are defined by the **clarity of your next decision**.
