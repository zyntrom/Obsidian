## 🧠 **Cognition, Schemas & Cognitive Dissonance – Notes & Summary**

---

### 🔹 **1. What is Cognition?**

- **Cognition** = The mental action/process of:
    - Knowing
    - Remembering
    - Understanding
    - Communicating
    - Learning
- The brain uses **mental shortcuts (heuristics)** to simplify complex thinking.
- Helps us **make quick decisions**, but can lead to **biases and errors**.

---

### 🔹 **2. What are Schemas?**

- **Schemas** = Mental frameworks or structures that help us organize and interpret information quickly.
    
- Think of them like **filing cabinets** in the brain:
    - E.g., Schema for **"classroom"**: You know how to behave, where to sit, who’s in charge (teacher), etc.
    - E.g., Schema for **"dog"**: four legs, barks, furry, friendly.
- They help us:
    - Respond automatically to familiar situations.
    - Interpret new experiences by fitting them into existing categories.
- **Everyone’s schemas are different** because of their unique experiences.

📝 **Activity Tip**: If asked in exams — describe how schemas work using the "classroom" or "dog" example.

### 🔹 **3. What is Cognitive Dissonance?**

- Introduced by **Leon Festinger**.
- Definition: **Discomfort** or tension when holding two or more **conflicting beliefs, values, or actions**.
- The mind tries to **reduce or resolve** this discomfort by:
    - Changing beliefs
    - Justifying behavior
    - Ignoring information

---

#### 💡 **Key Example 1: The Fox and the Grapes**

- Fox can’t reach grapes → says grapes are sour.
- Conflict:
    - “I want grapes” vs “I can’t reach grapes” → resolves by believing grapes are not worth it.
- **Moral**: Changing belief to reduce discomfort = cognitive dissonance.

---

#### 💡 **Key Example 2: Aryan’s Belief**

- Aryan believes: “All meat-eaters are cruel.”
- His friend eats meat but is kind.
- Conflict:
    - “Friend is kind” vs “Friend eats meat.”
- Resolution:
    - Change belief → “Not all meat-eaters are cruel” **OR**
    - Force belief → “Friend is secretly cruel.”

### 🔹 **4. Real-life Impact of Cognitive Dissonance**

#### ✅ **Decision Making & Attitude Formation**

- Our **attitudes** can change just to resolve internal conflicts.
- We often **justify past choices** to feel consistent and confident.

#### ✅ **Example: Sunk-Cost Fallacy**

- Paid ₹2000 for arcade, but fancy restaurant is a better option.
- Still chooses arcade to avoid dissonance:
    - Conflict: “Paid money” vs “Not going.”
    - Mind resolves by sticking to original plan (even if worse).
- This is **irrational** but common due to cognitive dissonance.

---

### 🔹 **5. Cognitive Dissonance Causes Other Biases**

- **Confirmation Bias**:
    - Favoring information that confirms what we already believe.
- **Memory Distortion**:
    - Altering or creating false memories to make past actions feel consistent.
- **Choice Justification**:
    - Liking the chosen option more after choosing (even if both were equal).


🧬 Even **animals** (primates) show signs of dissonance resolution — shows how **deeply rooted** this is in our brains.

### 🔹 **6. Summary for Revision**

- **Schemas** = Automatic, mental structures that guide our understanding based on experience.
- **Cognition** = Mental process of knowing, learning, thinking.
- **Cognitive Dissonance** = Discomfort from conflicting thoughts/actions → leads to belief/behavior change.
- Affects:
    - Decision making
    - Biases (e.g., confirmation, sunk-cost fallacy)
    - Attitude formation
- Our brain prefers **consistency**, even if it means ignoring truth.
