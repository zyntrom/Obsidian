## 🧠 **Biases, Heuristics, and Judgements – Summary & Notes**

---

### 🔹 **What Are Heuristics?**

- **Heuristics** = Mental shortcuts used for quick decisions and problem-solving.
- Useful in saving time and effort, **but can lead to biases or wrong judgments**.
- Operates mostly through **System 1** thinking (fast, automatic, emotional).

### 🧠 **System 1 vs System 2 Thinking**

|System|Features|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**System 1**|Fast, automatic, emotional, intuitive|“I just _felt_ she was nice”|
|**System 2**|Slow, logical, effortful, rational|Analyzing pros and cons before making a choice|

> Most of our judgments are driven by **System 1** unless we actively provoke **System 2**.

### 🔸 **Exercise #1: Judging People by Looks**

- **What happened?**
    - You judged people based on appearance.
    - E.g., assumed Person A was old-fashioned, Person B was smart.
- This is **judgment heuristic** in action: your brain used **limited info** to form a quick opinion.
- System 1 jumped to conclusions; System 2 probably didn’t interfere.

---

### 🔸 **Exercise #2: Risk Perception**

- Which is riskier: Shark diver or cattle rancher?
- **What happened?**
    - You likely said "shark diver", though **cattle-related deaths are more 
    common**.
    - This is due to **availability heuristic** – we overestimate risk based on **how easily examples come to mind** (shark attacks are more dramatic).

---

### 🔸 **Exercise #3: Crash & Rainy Day**

- After reading about a plane crash, would you still go to Singapore?
- Most would avoid the trip, **even though the event is rare**.
- This shows how **recent events** and **emotions** bias your thinking.
- A **heuristic** influenced by **availability + emotion**.

---

### 🔸 **Exercise #4: Context & Ambiguity**

- You saw:
    - A B C
    - 12 13 14  
        → But the **"B" and "13" were identical**!
- Why did you interpret it differently?
    - **Context** guided your reading.
    - System 1 **constructed a single, plausible story** and ignored ambiguity.
    - System 1 doesn’t consider alternate meanings.
- Example: "Bank" can mean **money** or **riverbank**, but your brain chooses one based on context.

---

### 🔸 **Concept: WYSIATI**

**WYSIATI = What You See Is All There Is**

- You believe that the limited information available is the full picture.
- Example:
    - "Mindik is intelligent and strong" → You think she’s a good leader.
    - If we add: "corrupt and cruel", your opinion would change drastically.
- System 1 jumps to conclusions without asking for **missing information**.
- System 2 requires **effort** and usually stays **lazy**.

---

### 🔸 **Exercise #5: Playground Swing Decision**

- Child 1 → Positive swing memory = low risk, runs to play.
- Child 2 → Negative swing memory = high risk, avoids swings.
- Why?
    - **Emotional heuristics** based on **past experience**.
    - Shows how **emotions strongly influence judgments**.

---

### 📌 **Major Biases Covered**

|Bias|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Judgment Heuristic**|Making assumptions based on appearances or quick cues|Thinking someone is smart based on looks|
|**Availability Heuristic**|Judging based on how easily something comes to mind|Shark attacks feel more dangerous than cattle|
|**WYSIATI**|Assuming the info you see is all that matters|Judging someone with just 1-2 adjectives|
|**Emotion Bias**|Letting past emotions shape decisions|Avoiding swings due to one bad experience|
|**Context Bias**|Interpreting things based on surrounding info|Seeing B/13 based on letter/number context|

---

### 🧠 **Tips for Overcoming Biases & Heuristics**

- **Activate System 2**: Question your first thoughts.
- **Pause before judging**: Ask for more info.
- **Be aware of emotional influence**: Check if fear or memory is driving your decision.
- **Recognize context**: Don't let it trick you into false certainty.
- **Don't trust only what you see**: There may be more to the story.

### ✅ **Full Lesson Summary**

- We often rely on **heuristics** and **System 1** thinking to make fast decisions.
- These shortcuts are efficient but **prone to errors and biases**.
- **Judgments are often emotional and context-dependent**.
- **WYSIATI** explains how we wrongly assume we know everything from limited info.
- To avoid poor decisions:
    - Use **System 2** thinking.
    - Question your assumptions.
    - Look for **alternate possibilities**.
