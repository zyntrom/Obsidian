## ✅ **Topic: Commitment Bias**

---

### 📌 **Introduction**

> “Why do we keep doubling down on decisions, even when they’re clearly not working?”

**Example**: Samar recommends a software. Later he finds a better one — but sticks to the original because he _committed_ to it.  
This feeling of loyalty to past decisions, even when they’re outdated or harmful, is known as **Commitment Bias** (or **Escalation of Commitment**).

---

### 🎯 **Definition**

> **Commitment Bias** is the tendency to stay loyal to a past decision, **even when it’s no longer the best choice**, because we’ve already committed to it.

It’s not just about what we’ve _invested_ (like in sunk cost fallacy), but about **identity, consistency, and reputation**.

### 🔄 **How It’s Different from the Sunk Cost Fallacy**

|Sunk Cost Fallacy|Commitment Bias|
|---|---|
|Driven by **resources already spent** (time, money, effort)|Driven by **desire to stay consistent** with past decisions|
|Fear of **wasting effort**|Fear of **admitting we were wrong**|
|Emotional attachment to effort|Emotional attachment to **identity** and **public image**|

**Example**:

- **Sunk Cost**: “I already paid for the course, so I’ll keep attending.”
- **Commitment Bias**: “I told everyone I’m doing economics. I can’t back out now.”

### 🧠 **Why It Happens**

1. **Desire for Consistency**
    - We like to see ourselves (and be seen) as **stable and reliable**.
    - Changing our mind feels like a threat to our identity.
2. **Self-Justification**
    - We want to prove that our past decisions were **smart**, not mistakes.
    - So, we double down instead of correcting course.
3. **Fear of Social Judgment**
    - We worry about what others will think if we change our minds.
    - Especially if we made our decision _publicly_.
4. **Discomfort with Being Wrong**
    - Admitting you were wrong can be **emotionally uncomfortable**.
    - It's easier to continue than to confront that feeling.

### 🧪 **Foot-in-the-Door Technique**

A classic psychological tactic that **uses small commitments** to create bigger ones later.

#### 🧾 Study by Freedman & Fraser:

- People were asked to put a **small sign** (“Be a Safe Driver”) in their yard → most agreed.
- 2 weeks later, the same people were asked to put up a **huge, ugly billboard**.
- **76% said yes** — because they saw themselves as “the type of person who supports safety causes.”

#### 💡 Lesson:

Small commitments **change how we see ourselves**, making us more likely to agree to larger ones later.  
This is a powerful example of **commitment bias at work**.

### ⚠️ **Real-World Impact**

- Sticking with ineffective strategies, tools, or beliefs
- Continuing in toxic relationships or unproductive academic paths
- Defending ideas or products you once supported, even when clearly outdated

Even experts fall for it — **Robert Cialdini** avoids signing petitions because of the **psychological effect on his self-image**.

### 🛡️ **Avoiding Commitment Bias**

From **The Decision Lab**:

1. **Challenge the need for consistency**
    - Ask: “Does this still reflect who I am and what I want?”
2. **Normalize changing your mind**
    - Growth and change are natural — not signs of failure.
3. **Let go of fear of judgment**
    - Most people **respect honesty** more than blind consistency.
4. **Focus on future benefits**
    - Make decisions based on **what will help you now**, not what you've already said or done.

### 🧠 **Key Reflection Question**

> _“If I were making this decision for the first time today, would I still choose the same thing?”_

If not — it might be time to re-evaluate.

### 💬 **Closing Thought**

Commitment can be a strength — but only when it serves your current values and goals.  
Sticking to the wrong path **just to appear consistent** can block growth, creativity, and smarter choices.
