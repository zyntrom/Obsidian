## **Representativeness Bias – Summary and Explanation**

### 🔍 **What Is Representativeness Bias?**

Representativeness bias is a **cognitive shortcut** where we judge the probability or characteristics of something based on how much it resembles an existing stereotype or mental image, rather than on actual statistics or base rates.

We **ignore logical reasoning or probability** and rely instead on how “representative” something appears to us.

### 🎯 **Example 1: Engineers vs Lawyers (Hypothetical Case)**

- A researcher interviews 70 engineers and 30 lawyers.
- You're shown two profiles:
    - Adam: Outgoing, likes politics, good at arguing.
    - Dick: 30, married, well-liked at work, successful.
- Without base-rate consideration, people often guess Adam is a lawyer based on personality traits.
- But **statistically**, there are **more engineers**, so **base-rate logic** suggests Adam is more likely to be an engineer.

### 🎭 **Example 2: The Concert**

- Sarah brings two friends: one is a **mathematician**, the other a **musician**.
- John wears glasses and is shy. Adam is outgoing and casual.
- Most people guess John = mathematician, Adam = musician.
- But in reality, **Adam is the mathematician**.
- This mistake happens because of **stereotype matching**.

### 🧠 **Why Does It Happen?**

Two main reasons:

1. **System 1 Thinking (Fast, Intuitive):** We make snap judgments based on impressions.
2. **Poor Grasp of Probability:** People often **ignore statistics (base rates)** when making judgments.

> _Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow):_  
> “A question about probability activates a mental shotgun, evoking easier answers.”

### ⚾ **Example from Sports: Moneyball**

- Traditional scouts judged players based on looks and style.
- **Billy Beane**, manager of Oakland A’s, used **statistics** (not appearance) to select undervalued players.
- This **data-driven strategy** outperformed traditional intuition-based methods.
- Described in the book/movie **Moneyball**.

### ✅ **When Representativeness Can Be Useful**

Sometimes, stereotypes are **statistically valid**:

- Friendly people often _are_ friendly.
- Tall, thin athletes more often play basketball than football.
- Young men are statistically more likely to drive aggressively.

But remember: **These are only probabilities, not certainties.**

### 🚫 **Dangers of the Bias**

- Causes you to **ignore base rates**
- Leads to **errors in judgment**
- Encourages reliance on **first impressions** or **stereotypes**

### 🛡️ **How to Avoid Representativeness Bias**

1. **Always check base rates and probabilities**
2. **Evaluate evidence carefully** before drawing conclusions
3. **Don’t let System 1 dominate** – pause and activate System 2 (slow, logical thinking)
