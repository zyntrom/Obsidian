## ✅ **Topic: Availability Heuristic / Bias**

---

### 🧠 **Definition**

> **Availability Bias** (or Heuristic) is a mental shortcut where people estimate the likelihood of an event based on how easily they can recall examples of it — even if those examples are not representative or statistically common.

---

### 🧩 **Core Concepts**

#### 1. **Ease of Recall**

- If something is **easy to remember**, we assume it **happens more often**.
- Influenced by how **vivid**, **recent**, or **emotional** the memory is.

##### 📌 Example:

- A shocking news story about a woman with AIDS trying to infect others led to a sudden rise in fear-driven behavior, even though it was **not representative of actual risk**.

#### 2. **Retrievability**

- We tend to remember things better if they match **common formats** or **patterns** we’re used to.
- Our brain retrieves words or ideas based on **familiar positions** (e.g., first letters).

##### 📌 Example:

- In a study, people thought there were more 7-letter words ending in “-ing” than with “n” in the 6th position, **even though every “-ing” word has “n” as the 6th letter**.
- It's just that “-ing” is easier to remember than focusing on the 6th letter.

### 🧪 **Examples (Real-world Cases)**

#### ✅ **Example 1: Terrorism Fear**

- A woman loses family to a terrorist attack.
- She believes terrorism is **more deadly than diabetes/heart issues**, ignoring **actual statistics**.

#### ✅ **Example 2: Smoking Logic**

- A boy defends smoking by recalling his grandpa who lived long despite smoking — overlooking **medical data**.

#### ✅ **Example 3: House Safety Assumption**

- A wife recalls a neighbor who didn’t lock his house and was never robbed.
- Uses that **single case** to argue the area is safe — ignoring real crime rates.

### 🌀 **Other Real-Life Examples**

- A woman robbed once begins distrusting all men, even family.
    
- A fisherman overestimates shark attacks after hearing about one case.
    
- Politicians use individual cold days to deny global warming, despite **global climate data**.
    
- A sports coach repeats old strategies just because they worked before, even if they’re **outdated** now.
    
- Fear of flying arises from **media stories about plane crashes**, not from **actual flying safety stats**.

### 📌 **Conclusion**

- **Availability bias** affects how we judge risk, safety, and truth.
    
- It’s based on **emotion, vividness, and recall**, not logic or data.
    
- Being aware of this bias helps us make **more rational, evidence-based decisions**.
