# Endowment Effect – Notes

## 1. Introduction

- The **Endowment Effect** is a cognitive bias where people **overvalue what they own**.
- Ownership increases the perceived value of an item, even if its market value remains the same.
- Challenges classical economic theory: value is **not independent of ownership**.

---

## 2. Thought Experiment

- Buy a mug for ₹300. Someone offers ₹300 to buy it from you → most **refuse to sell**.
- Feeling of loss arises despite no actual monetary change → explained by **Prospect Theory**.
- Key idea: **Loss aversion** → losing something hurts more than gaining an equivalent item feels good.

---

## 3. Prospect Theory Connection

- **Reference Point:** Ownership becomes the status quo → losing the item is perceived as a loss.
- **Loss Aversion:** Losses are felt roughly **twice as strongly** as equivalent gains.
- Ownership increases **personal value**, not market value.

## 4. Real-Life Examples

### a) Professor R’s Wine

- Owned wine bottles → reluctant to sell for $100
- Would not buy same bottle for more than $35
- Buying vs selling prices gap → demonstrates **endowment effect**

### b) Concert Tickets

- Bought ticket for $200 → won’t sell for less than $3,000
- Personal attachment inflates perceived value

---

## 5. When the Effect Disappears

- Routine transactions (coins, shoes) → items held for exchange → **loss aversion not triggered**
- Items held for **personal use** → endowment effect applies
- **Trading experience** reduces effect → seeing possessions as **exchangeable assets** rather than personal treasures

---

## 6. Key Takeaways

1. Endowment effect is **caused by loss aversion** and change in reference point.
2. Ownership shifts perception → increases subjective value.
3. Awareness and experience can reduce bias → think like a **trader**.
4. Overcoming initial attachment helps make **more rational decisions**.
