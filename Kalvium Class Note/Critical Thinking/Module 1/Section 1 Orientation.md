## What is Critical Thinking?

### Key Traits of Critical Thinking

- **Skepticism** – Doubting the truth of things
- **Objectivity** – Seeing from a neutral point of view
- **Reasoning** – Explaining why we believe something
- **Open-mindedness** – Changing our minds when facts change

🧠 Our brain prefers **low-energy choices**. It’s easier to choose between A or B than to **question the premise**.
