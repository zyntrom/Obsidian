## Ego Depletion

Let’s start with a powerful idea: the human brain is like a power unit. And like any power unit, it has **limited capacity**—especially when it comes to mental energy. To preserve this energy, your brain often tries to conserve effort whenever possible.

### What is Ego Depletion?

**Ego depletion** refers to the **draining of mental energy** required to resist base impulses and make conscious decisions. Whether you're resisting that gooey cheese pizza or solving a complex math problem, your brain’s self-control reserves are getting used up.

And once that mental energy is depleted? You’re more likely to give in to temptation, make errors, and rely on quick, automatic thinking.

### The Hungry Judge Effect

So how serious is ego depletion? Serious enough to affect people in positions of power—like **judges**.
Even something as simple as hunger can tip the scales in major legal decisions!

## The Lazy System

This brings us to a big insight: 🧠 **The mind is a lazy system.**

It’s always trying to **save energy**—and often takes shortcuts unless absolutely necessary. When we’re mentally exhausted, **System 2 (the analytical part of the mind)** goes off-duty, and quick, automatic decisions from **System 1** take over.

When we’re mentally tired, these kinds of errors happen more frequently. System 2 is the gatekeeper that prevents faulty logic—but only when it has energy left.

## Willpower and the Mind

### Why Does This Matter?

Because **willpower can be trained.** Every time you resist a distraction or temptation, you’re building that self-control muscle.
