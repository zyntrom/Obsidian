## IDEA MODEL

- Presents the **IDEA** model for structured problem-solving.
    
- Helps avoid random trial-and-error approaches.
    

---

### 🔸 Step 1: **Identify**

- Define the **actual problem**, not just the symptoms.
    
- Use tools like **cause-and-effect diagrams**.
    
- Ask: _“What’s really going wrong?”_
    

---

### 🔸 Step 2: **Develop**

- Brainstorm **multiple solutions** without judgment.
    
- Think creatively—**divergent thinking** is key.
    
- Group ideas by **feasibility** or **impact**.
    

---

### 🔸 Step 3: **Execute**

- Select the most promising solution.
    
- Implement it with **clear steps, milestones, and accountability**.
    
- Start small with a **pilot run**, if possible.
    

---

### 🔸 Step 4: **Assess**

- Evaluate whether the solution worked.
    
- Use **metrics and feedback** to measure effectiveness.
    
- If not successful, **loop back** and iterate.
    

---

### 📝 Conclusion & Tips

- Use IDEA for personal, team, or organizational problems.
    
- Strength: Simple and adaptable.
    
- Limitation: May require tweaks for complex or technical issues.
    

## Scientific Method

**1. Observation & Question**

- Scientists begin by noticing something interesting or unexpected in their environment.
    
- This observation leads to a question like, _“Why did my bread not toast?”_
    

**2. Hypothesis Formation & Prediction**

- They form a **hypothesis**, a testable explanation (e.g., toaster isn’t plugged in).
    
- Based on that, they predict what should happen if the hypothesis is correct.
    

**3. Testing the Hypothesis**

- Conduct an experiment or test the prediction (e.g., plug into a working socket).
    
- The test must be systematic and controlled—change only one variable at a time.
    

**4. Analyze & Interpret Results**

- Look at the outcomes: if the toaster works after being plugged in, the hypothesis is supported; if not, it’s rejected.
    
- Even supported hypotheses aren’t proof—they simply gain credibility through testing.
    

**5. Iteration**

- If results don’t fit expectations, refine the hypothesis or pose a new one.
    
- Rinse and repeat until findings become reliable.
    

**6. Broader Understanding & Communication**

- Beyond testing, the method requires **systematic observation**, asking **empirical questions**, and sharing findings publicly.

- Publishing allows peer review and collaborative self-correction.

## Wood's Problem Solving Model

Similar to what we saw in Jenny’s case, and the IDEA model that you saw in the beginning of the lesson, another good problem solving model for handy use in any situation is the Woods’ Problem-solving Model. In short, the model consists of the following broad steps:

1. Define the problem
2. Think about it
3. Plan a solution
4. Carry out the plan
5. Look back (and maybe iterate)

## Being Solution-Minded

### 🔧 Embrace a “Figure‑It‑Out‑Able” Mindset

She champions the belief that **every problem has a solution** and you **have the capability** to find it. This confidence sets the foundation for effective problem-solving [Course Hero+6YouTube+6YTScribe+6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaYVqj1El1A&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

### 🗺️ Build Your Own Framework

Glantz relies on structured frameworks—checklists, step-by-step guides, and notes—to turn complex issues into manageable projects. It helps demystify challenges and gives a clear process for action .

---

### ❓Ask the Right Questions

Asking clarifying questions is key. Don't shy away from querying colleagues, mentors, or even Google. This step ensures the **solution** you pursue actually **addresses the real problem** .

---

### 🏋️‍♀️ Practice Makes Progress

She frames solution-mindedness as a **skill**, not a gift. Regularly apply your framework to daily problems and refine it over time—tuning your approach and gaining agility.

---

### ⏳ Patience with Yourself and Others

New ways of working take time. Be patient with your process and the people involved. This fosters trust, allows adaptation, and cultivates an environment where solving problems becomes a collective effort .

---

### 🎯 Underlying Message

- **Mindset**: Believe you _can_ solve it.
    
- **Structure**: Use a method that suits your thinking style.
    
- **Questions**: Clarify the problem before jumping to solutions.
    
- **Practice**: Build proficiency through repetition.
    
- **Patience**: Growth comes through sustained effort and collaboration.
