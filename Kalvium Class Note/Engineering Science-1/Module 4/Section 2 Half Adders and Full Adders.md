# Half Adders and Full Adders â€” Notes

## What are Adders?

- Circuits that perform **binary addition**.
- Two main types:
    - **Half Adder (HA):** Adds 2 single-bit inputs. No carry-in.
    - **Full Adder (FA):** Adds 3 inputs (2 bits + carry-in).

## Half Adder (HA)

- **Inputs:** A, B
- **Outputs:**
    - Sum = A âŠ• B (XOR gate)
    - Carry = A Â· B (AND gate)
- **Truth Table (HA):**

|A|B|Sum|Carry|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|0|
|1|0|1|0|
|1|1|0|1|

- **Use case:** Basic two-bit addition.

## Full Adder (FA)

- **Inputs:** A, B, Cin (carry-in)
- **Outputs:**
    - Sum = (A âŠ• B) âŠ• Cin
    - Carry = (A Â· B) + (Cin Â· (A âŠ• B))
- Uses: 2 XORs, 2 ANDs, 1 OR.
- **Truth Table (FA):**

| A   | B   | Cin | Sum | Cout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0    |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0    |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0    |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1    |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0    |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1    |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1    |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1    |

## Cascading Adders (Multi-Bit Addition)

- Connect multiple **full adders in series**.
- Carry-out of one stage â†’ carry-in of next.
- Example: 4-bit adder needs 4 FAs.

## Ripple-Carry Adder

- Simple method: carry ripples through adders one by one.
- **Limitation:** Slower for large numbers (carry propagation delay).
- Optimization: Use **Carry Lookahead Adders** for speed.

---

## Quick Summary

- **Half Adder:** XOR (sum), AND (carry).
- **Full Adder:** Handles carry-in, Sum = (AâŠ•B)âŠ•Cin, Carry = AB + Cin(AâŠ•B).
- **Truth tables** verify functionality.
- **Ripple-carry adders** are easy but slow; advanced designs overcome this.
