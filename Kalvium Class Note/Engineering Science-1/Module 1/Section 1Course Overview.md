### ⚙️ **Material Science ↔ Electronics**

Every electronic device relies on **Material Science**:

- **Conductors (e.g., Copper):** Let current flow freely.
    
- **Insulators (e.g., Plastic, Glass):** Block current flow.
    
- **Semiconductors (e.g., Silicon):** Can act as both — based on external conditions.
    

#### ⭐ Key Concept: **Doping**

- Altering silicon by adding elements like **boron** or **phosphorus**.
    
- Controls conductivity.
    
- Enables creation of **transistors**, **logic gates**, and **processors**.
