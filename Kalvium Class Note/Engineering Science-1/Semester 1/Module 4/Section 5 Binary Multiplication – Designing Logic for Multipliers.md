## Binary Multiplication â€“ Designing Logic for Multipliers (Kalvium AL 4.5)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand binary multiplication via **shift-and-add** method.
- Learn how **logic gates** and **adders** build multiplier circuits.
- Differentiate between **signed** and **unsigned** multiplication.
- Explore **real-world applications** of binary multipliers.

### Concept of Binary Multiplication

- Works like decimal multiplication:
    1. Multiply each bit of multiplier with multiplicand.
    2. Shift and add partial products.
- **Binary rules:**
    - 0 Ã— 0 = 0
    - 0 Ã— 1 = 0
    - 1 Ã— 0 = 0
    - 1 Ã— 1 = 1
- Advantage: Simple rules â†’ hardware efficient.

### Shift-and-Add Algorithm

1. Scan each bit of the multiplier (from LSB to MSB).
2. For each bit:
    - If 1 â†’ add shifted multiplicand to result.
    - If 0 â†’ skip.
3. Shift multiplicand left after each iteration.
4. Accumulate results â†’ final product.

Used in **CPUs/ALUs** for efficient multiplication.

### Hardware Implementation

- **AND gates:** Generate partial products (bitwise multiplication).
- **Adders:** Combine partial products.
    - Half Adder â†’ adds 2 bits (sum + carry).
    - Full Adder â†’ adds 3 inputs (sum + carry-out).
- Adders are layered to handle shifted sums.

---

### Designing Binary Multiplier Circuits

- **2-bit Multiplier:**
    - 4 AND gates for partial products.
    - Adders sum them with shifts.
- **4-bit Multiplier:**
    - 16 AND gates for all bit combinations.
    - Multiple full adders combine results.
- Complexity grows **quadratically** with bit size â†’ optimized designs are crucial for speed.

### Signed vs. Unsigned Multiplication

**Unsigned Multiplication**

- Assumes all numbers are positive.
- Straightforward application of shift-and-add.
- Example: 5 (0101) Ã— 3 (0011) = 15 (1111).

**Signed Multiplication (Twoâ€™s Complement)**

- MSB = sign (0 â†’ positive, 1 â†’ negative).
- Negative numbers â†’ twoâ€™s complement form.
- Steps:
    1. Convert negatives to twoâ€™s complement.
    2. Multiply as if unsigned.
    3. Determine result sign:
        - (+ Ã— +) â†’ +
        - (+ Ã— â€“) â†’ â€“
        - (â€“ Ã— â€“) â†’ +
- Important for real-world systems (DSP, control, AI).
