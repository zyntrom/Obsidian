## 🔦 **Lesson Summary: Diodes and Their Applications**

🔁 **Why Diodes Matter in Computer Science**  
Think your software is perfect, but your IoT project keeps glitching? Like Arjun’s case, the **real issue might be hardware**—and diodes are the tiny heroes fixing power instability, signal issues, and microcontroller resets. CS engineers need to understand diodes to build smarter, more reliable systems.

### 📌 **Key Concepts**

🔌 **What Is a Diode?**  
A **diode** is a two-terminal electronic component:
- **Anode (+)**: Positive terminal
- **Cathode (−)**: Negative terminal  
    It allows **current to flow in one direction only**, blocking it in the reverse—like a one-way gate for electricity.

⚙️ **Working of a Diode**
- **Made from a PN Junction**:
    - **N-type** has extra electrons
    - **P-type** has holes (positive charge carriers)
- **Forward Bias**:  
    Current flows when the anode is connected to positive and cathode to negative.
    - Needs minimum voltage: **0.7V for silicon**, **0.3V for germanium**
- **Reverse Bias**:  
    Voltage is applied in reverse → no current (except a tiny leakage from minority carriers)
