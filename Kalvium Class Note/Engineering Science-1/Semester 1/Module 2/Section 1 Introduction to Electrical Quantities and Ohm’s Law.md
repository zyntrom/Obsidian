## ⚡ **Introduction to Electrical Quantities & Ohm’s Law – Summary**

### 🧠 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, you can:

- Define **voltage**, **current**, and **resistance**
- Understand and apply **Ohm’s Law**
- Calculate **power** in circuits
- Analyze simple **electrical circuits**
- Recognize key **circuit components** and their functions

### 🔌 **What is Electricity?**

**Electricity** is the **flow of electric charge**, usually via **electrons** in a conductor like copper.

🔁 **Water Analogy**:

- **Voltage** = water pressure (push)
- **Current** = flow rate of water (amount of charge flowing)
- **Resistance** = pipe size (restriction to flow)

---

### 🔋 **Understanding Voltage**

- **Voltage** (V) is the **potential difference** that drives electric charges through a circuit.
- Measured in **volts (V)**
- Example sources:
    - **AA Battery** = 1.5V
    - **Car Battery** = ~12V

---

### ⚡ **Exploring Current**

- **Current** (I) is the **rate of flow** of electric charge.
- Measured in **amperes (A)**
- Two Types:
    - **DC (Direct Current)** – constant direction (e.g., battery)
    - **AC (Alternating Current)** – periodically changes direction (e.g., home supply)

Example: Wall sockets provide **AC**, but phone chargers convert it to **DC** for the battery.

---

### ⛔ **Delving into Resistance**

- **Resistance** (R) opposes the flow of current.
- Measured in **ohms (Ω)**
- High resistance = less current
- Factors affecting resistance:
    - **Material** (e.g., copper vs rubber)
    - **Length** (longer wire = more resistance)
    - **Thickness** (thinner wire = more resistance)
    - **Temperature** (usually increases resistance)

💡 **Resistors** are components used to **limit or control** current in a circuit.

### 🧮 **Ohm’s Law: V = I × R**

This key formula links voltage, current, and resistance.

- **V = I × R**
- Can also rearrange to:
    - **I = V / R**
    - **R = V / I**

📌 **Example (Live session problem)**:  
A 9V battery is connected to a 3Ω resistor.  
**I = 9 / 3 = 3A**

📌 **Practice Question**:  
If a toaster draws **5A** and has **10Ω** resistance, what’s the voltage?  
**V = I × R = 5 × 10 = 50V**

---

### 🔋 **Power in Electrical Circuits**

**Power (P)** is the rate at which energy is consumed or converted.

- **P = V × I**
- Alternative forms (via Ohm’s Law):
    - **P = I² × R**
    - **P = V² / R**

📌 **Example**:  
Device at 10V drawing 2A:  
**P = 10 × 2 = 20W**

---

### 🔁 **Simple Circuit Components**

Every circuit needs:

1. **Power Source** (e.g., battery)
2. **Conductive Path** (e.g., wires)
3. **Load/Resistor** (e.g., bulb, motor)

🔌 **Circuit Types**:

- **Series**: One path, same current everywhere
- **Parallel**: Multiple paths, same voltage across each path

---

### 📏 **Measurement Tools**

**Multimeter** measures:

- **Voltage**
- **Current**
- **Resistance**

✅ **Safety Tips**:

- Turn off power before testing
- Use insulated tools
- Avoid water during work

---

### 🛠️ **Real-Life Examples**

- **Phone Chargers**: Convert AC to DC
- **LED Bulbs**: Use resistors to protect from overcurrent
- **Toasters**: Use high-resistance wires to generate heat

---

### 💡 **Discussion Prompt**

Think of any device:

- Where is the **voltage** coming from?
- What’s acting as a **resistor**?
- How does **current** flow?

---
