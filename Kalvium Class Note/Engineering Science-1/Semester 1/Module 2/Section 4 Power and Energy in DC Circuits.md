### 🔁 **Ohm’s Law Refresher**

>  **V = I × R**  
> This basic relationship connects **voltage (V)**, **current (I)**, and **resistance (R)**.

---

### ⚡ **What is Electrical Power?**

> Power is the **rate** at which energy is used or converted in a circuit.

**Common Power Formulas:**

- **P = V × I**  (Voltage × Current)
- **P = I² × R**  (Current squared × Resistance)
- **P = V² / R**  (Voltage squared ÷ Resistance)

📌 **Units**: Watts (W)

🧮 **Example 1**:  
12V battery + 6Ω resistor  
P = V² / R = (12²) / 6 = 144 / 6 = **24W**

This resistor uses 24 watts of power.

### ⚙️ **What is Electrical Energy?**

> Energy is the **total work** done or energy transferred over time.

**Formula:**  
 **E = P × t**

📌 **Units**:

- Joules (J) – when **time is in seconds**
- Watt-hours (Wh) or kilowatt-hours (kWh) – when **time is in hours**

🧮 **Example 2**:  
100W bulb used for 5 hours:  
E = 100 × 5 = **500Wh = 0.5 kWh**

---

### 🏠 **Energy Consumption in Daily Life**

> Real appliances consume power over time, which adds up on your **electricity bill**.

🧮 **Example 3 – Microwave**:

- 1000W used for 0.5h daily
- Daily = 0.5 kWh
- Monthly = 0.5 × 30 = **15 kWh**
- At $0.20/kWh → 15 × 0.20 = **$3.00/month**

📌 This small usage adds up—understanding it helps you control your energy bills.

### ⚙️ **Efficiency: Not All Power is Useful**

> Some energy is wasted (e.g., heat). Efficiency tells us how much is **usefully converted**.

**Efficiency Formula**:  
 **Efficiency (%) = (Output Power / Input Power) × 100**

🧮 **Example 4 – Bulbs**:

- LED: 10W input → 9W light = 90%
- Incandescent: 60W input → 6W light = 10%

📌 **LEDs save energy** because they convert more power into useful light.

### 🔋 **Battery Capacity: How Long Will It Last?**

**Key Units**:

|Unit|Meaning|
|---|---|
|mAh (milliamp-hours)|Charge supplied over time|
|Wh (watt-hours)|Energy delivered (P × t)|

**Runtime Formula**:  
 **Time (hours) = Battery Capacity (Wh) / Power (W)**

🧮 **Example 5**:  
Battery = 10Wh, Device uses 2W  
→ Time = 10 / 2 = **5 hours**

---

### ✍️ **Hands-On Practice: Real-Life Examples**

**Problem 1: Laptop Charger**  
Rated 120V, 1.5A  
→ P = V × I = 120 × 1.5 = **180W**

**Problem 2: Electric Heater**  
1500W used for 2 hours  
→ E = P × t = 1500 × 2 = **3000Wh = 3 kWh**

**Problem 3: Phone Battery**  
3000mAh at 3.7V  
→ Convert mAh to Ah = 3Ah  
→ E = V × Ah = 3.7 × 3 = **11.1Wh**

---

### 📌 **Summary**

You learned to:

- Use formulas: **P = V × I**, **P = I² × R**, **P = V² / R**
