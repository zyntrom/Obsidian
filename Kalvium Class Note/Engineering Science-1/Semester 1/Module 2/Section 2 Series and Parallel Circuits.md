### 🔌 **Basics of Series and Parallel Circuits**

---

## ✅ **Lesson Objectives**

- Understand structure and working of **Series and Parallel circuits**
- Learn to **calculate total resistance**
- Analyze **how voltage and current behave**
- Apply concepts to **real-world examples and problems**

---

## 🔄 **Understanding Series Circuits**

> 🔗 All components are connected in **one continuous path** (like cars on a single-lane road).

### 🔑 **Key Features**

- **Same current** flows through all components
- **Total resistance = sum of all resistors**
- **Voltage divides** among the resistors

### 📐 **Formula for Total Resistance**

> **Rₜ = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...**

### 📘 **Example 1:**

3 resistors: 5Ω, 10Ω, and 15Ω in series  
**Rₜ = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30Ω**

---

### ⚡ **Voltage & Current in Series**

- **Current stays the same** through each resistor
- **Voltage drop (V) = I × R** for each resistor

### 📘 **Example 2:**

12V battery with 3Ω and 6Ω in series  
Let’s say total current is **I**

- Total Resistance = 3 + 6 = 9Ω
- **I = V / R = 12 / 9 = 1.33A**
- Voltage drop across 3Ω = 1.33 × 3 = **4V**
- Voltage drop across 6Ω = 1.33 × 6 = **8V**

✅ _Total adds up to 12V — it checks out!_

### 🧠 **Real Life Insight**:

Christmas lights or old string lights → if one bulb fails, all go out!

## 🔁 **Understanding Parallel Circuits**

> 🛣️ Like a multi-lane highway — current can split and flow in multiple paths.

### 🔑 **Key Features**

- **Same voltage** across each branch
- **Total resistance decreases** as more resistors are added
- **Current splits** based on resistance of each branch

---

### 📐 **Formula for Total Resistance**

> **1/Rₜ = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ + ...**  
> For 2 resistors:  
> **Rₜ = (R₁ × R₂) / (R₁ + R₂)**

### 📘 **Example 3:**

6Ω and 3Ω in parallel  
**Rₜ = (6 × 3) / (6 + 3) = 18 / 9 = 2Ω**

---

### ⚡ **Voltage & Current in Parallel**

- **Voltage is the same** in each branch
- Current in a branch = **I = V / R**

### 📘 **Example 4:**

12V battery connected to 4Ω and 12Ω in parallel:

- Current in 4Ω = 12 / 4 = **3A**
- Current in 12Ω = 12 / 12 = **1A**
- **Total current = 3A + 1A = 4A**

### 🧠 **Real Life Insight**:

Home wiring — if your fan breaks, your fridge still works!

## 🧪 **Let's Practice**

### 📝 **Problem 1: Series Circuit**

9V battery, resistors: 2Ω and 7Ω in series  
**Rₜ = 2 + 7 = 9Ω**  
**I = 9 / 9 = 1A**  
Voltage drop across:

- 2Ω = 1 × 2 = **2V**
- 7Ω = 1 × 7 = **7V**

### 📝 **Problem 2: Parallel Circuit**

12V battery, resistors: 6Ω and 3Ω in parallel  
**Rₜ = (6 × 3) / (6 + 3) = 18 / 9 = 2Ω**  
**I = V / R = 12 / 2 = 6A**

## ⚠️ **Common Mistakes**

### ❌ In Series:

- Assuming one component fails → current still flows ❌
- Multiplying resistances instead of adding ❌

### ❌ In Parallel:

- Thinking voltage divides ❌ (It stays the same)
- Wrongly applying Ohm’s Law with incorrect resistance values ❌

## 🌍 **Real-Life Applications**

- **Series:** Decorative string lights, some old fuse-based circuits
- **Parallel:** Household wiring, phone chargers, appliances

- Distinguish **series vs parallel** circuits
- **Calculate total resistance** accurately
- Understand **how current and voltage behave** in each type
- Apply **Ohm’s Law** effectively to real-world problems
