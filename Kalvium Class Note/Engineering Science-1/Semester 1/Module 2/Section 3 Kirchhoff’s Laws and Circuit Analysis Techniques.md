### ⚙️ **Quick Refresher: Electrical Quantities**

|Quantity|Description|Unit|
|---|---|---|
|Voltage (V)|Electrical pressure driving current|Volts (V)|
|Current (I)|Flow of electric charge|Amperes (A)|
|Resistance (R)|Opposition to current flow|Ohms (Ω)|

**Ohm’s Law:**  
  **V = I × R**

📌 **Check Your Understanding Example**:  
10V battery and 2Ω resistor:  
 I = V / R = **10 / 2 = 5A**

### 🔁 **Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)**

> 🔌 **At any node, the sum of incoming current equals the sum of outgoing current.**

**Formula:**  
  ∑I₍in₎ = ∑I₍out₎

📍**Node** = A point where 2 or more elements connect.

🧠 **Analogy**: Like traffic at a roundabout—cars in = cars out (no buildup).

🧮 **Example 1**:

- I₁ = 3A (in), I₂ = 2A (in), I₃ = ? (out)  
     → I₃ = 3 + 2 = **5A out**

### 🔁 **Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)**

> 🔋 **In any closed loop, the total voltage rise and drop equals zero.**

**Formula:**  
  ∑V = 0

🧠 **Analogy**: Hiking in a loop trail—total elevation change = 0

🧮 **Example 2**:

- Battery = 12V
- R₁ = 2Ω, I = 2A → V₁ = 4V
- R₂ = 4Ω, I = 2A → V₂ = 8V  
    → V₁ + V₂ = 12V  
    → ∑V = 12 - 4 - 8 = 0 ✅

### 🔧 **Node Voltage Analysis (Using KCL)**

> A method to solve complex circuits by analyzing **voltages at nodes**.

**Steps:**

1. Choose reference node (ground = 0V)
2. Label other node voltages (V₁, V₂...)
3. Apply KCL at each non-reference node
4. Use Ohm’s Law: I = (V₁ − V₂) / R
5. Solve the resulting equations

🔑 **Best for**: Circuits with multiple nodes and fewer loops

---

### 🔄 **Mesh Current Analysis (Using KVL)**

> A method using **loop currents** to solve for unknowns.

**Steps:**

1. Identify all independent loops (meshes)
2. Assign loop currents (I₁, I₂...)
3. Apply KVL around each loop
4. Use Ohm’s Law to express voltage drops
5. Solve the system of equations

🔑 **Best for**: Circuits with fewer meshes and more components

🧮 **Example 4** – Two Meshes (shared resistor):

- Mesh 1: 12V source, R₁ = 2Ω, R₃ = 1Ω (shared)
- Mesh 2: R₂ = 3Ω, R₃ = 1Ω (shared)

Assign I₁, I₂  
**Mesh 1 KVL**: 12 − 2I₁ − 1(I₁ − I₂) = 0 → 12 − 3I₁ + I₂ = 0  
**Mesh 2 KVL**: 3I₂ + 1(I₂ − I₁) = 0 → −I₁ + 4I₂ = 0  
→ Solve these equations to get I₁ and I₂

### 🧠 **When to Use What?**

|Situation|Recommended Method|
|---|---|
|Circuit has more **nodes**|Node Voltage Analysis|
|Circuit has more **loops**|Mesh Current Analysis|
|Looking for **voltage at points**|Node Voltage|
|Looking for **current in loops**|Mesh Current|

🔍 **Pro Tip**: Count unknowns vs number of independent equations before choosing method!

### ❗ **Common Pitfalls**

|Mistake|Fix|
|---|---|
|Forgetting sign conventions in KVL|Use consistent polarity (drop vs rise)|
|Mixing up mesh and branch currents|Clearly define directions and label currents|
|Using wrong reference node in Node Voltage|Always ground the lowest or most connected node|
|Ignoring shared elements between meshes|Include interaction terms like (I₁ − I₂)|
