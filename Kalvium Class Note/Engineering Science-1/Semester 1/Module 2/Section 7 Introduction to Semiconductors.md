## 🔋 **Lesson Summary: Introduction to Semiconductors**

👨‍💻 **Why It Matters for CS Students**  
Understanding semiconductors is like knowing the foundation of a skyscraper before writing software for it. Whether you’re designing algorithms or coding for AI, IoT, or quantum computing—**semiconductors are the bedrock of modern computing**.

### 📌 **Key Concepts**

🧪 **What Is a Semiconductor?**  
A semiconductor is a material with electrical conductivity **between** a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like rubber).

- Most common: **Silicon**
- Other types: **Germanium**, **Gallium Arsenide**

📉 **How It Works:**
- Conducts electricity **under certain conditions** due to **electron movement** across energy bands.
- **Band Gap**: Small energy difference that allows for controlled conduction.

🔬 **Types of Semiconductors:**
1. **Intrinsic:** Pure form (e.g., pure silicon)
2. **Extrinsic:** Doped with impurities to improve conductivity
    - **N-Type:** Doped with elements like phosphorus → adds electrons (negative charge carriers)
    - **P-Type:** Doped with elements like boron → creates holes (positive charge carriers)

⚡ **The PN Junction:**  
When N-type and P-type semiconductors are joined, they form a **PN junction**—the basic building block of:

- **Diodes** (let current flow one way)
- **Transistors** (act as switches/amplifiers)
