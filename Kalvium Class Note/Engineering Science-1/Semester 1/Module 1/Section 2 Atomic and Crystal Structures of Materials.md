---

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

You will learn to:

- Explain how atomic bonding and crystal structure affect material properties.
- Identify crystal structures and Miller indices.
- Recognize imperfections in solids.
- Understand how engineers use defects to improve materials.

## 🔗 **Atomic Bonds and Material Properties**

Think of **atomic bonds like LEGO bricks** – the way atoms are connected changes the properties of materials.

### 1. **Ionic Bonds**

- Formed by **electron transfer** between atoms (metal + non-metal).
- Create **positive and negative ions** → strong electrostatic attraction.
- **Properties**:
    - High melting/boiling points
    - Brittle
    - Good insulators
    - Conduct electricity only in molten or dissolved state
    - ❗Example: NaCl (salt)

---

### 2. **Covalent Bonds**

- **Electron sharing** between non-metal atoms.
- **Directional** and very strong bonds.
- **Properties**:
    - Hard (e.g., diamond)
    - High melting point
    - Poor conductors
    - ❗Example: Diamond, Silicon

---

### 3. **Metallic Bonds**

- Atoms share a **"sea of electrons"** – free-moving electrons around positive ions.
- **Properties**:
    - Malleable, ductile
    - High electrical and thermal conductivity
    - ❗Example: Copper

### 📊 **Comparison of Bond Types**

|Property|Ionic|Covalent|Metallic|
|---|---|---|---|
|Formation|Electron transfer|Electron sharing|Electron cloud|
|Conductivity|Poor|Very poor|Excellent|
|Melting Point|High|Variable|High|
|Malleability|No|No|Yes|
|Ductility|No|No|Yes|
|Bond Direction|Non-directional|Directional|Non-directional|

## 🧱 **Crystal Structures: Arrangements of Atoms**

Like oranges stacked in a pattern, **crystal structures** describe **how atoms are arranged in space**.

### 🧊 Key Terms

- **Lattice**: Repeating 3D pattern/grid
- **Basis**: Atoms attached to lattice points
- **Unit Cell**: Smallest repeatable unit of the lattice

### 📦 **Common Crystal Structures**

|Structure|Atoms per Unit Cell|Example|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**SC**|1|Rare|Least efficient (52%)|
|**BCC**|2|Iron (room temp)|Moderate efficiency (68%)|
|**FCC**|4|Al, Cu|High efficiency (74%)|
|**HCP**|6|Magnesium|Also ~74% packing|

---

## 🧮 **Packing Efficiency and Density**

- **Definition**: % of unit cell volume occupied by atoms
- Higher efficiency → higher **density** and **strength**
- **FCC & HCP**: ~74% (most efficient)
- **BCC**: ~68%
- **SC**: ~52%

---

## 📐 **Miller Indices: Naming Crystal Planes**

Used to **label directions and planes** inside crystals.

**How to find (hkl):**

1. Find intercepts with axes (in unit lengths).
2. Take reciprocals.
3. Multiply to eliminate fractions.
4. Write as (hkl).

❗Useful for understanding how materials break or deform.

## ⚠️ **Imperfections in Solids**

Real materials are **not perfect**—defects can drastically affect performance.

### 🧩 Types of Defects:

|Type|Dimensionality|Description & Effect|
|---|---|---|
|**Point Defects**|0D|Missing/misplaced atoms → affect strength, conductivity|
|**Line Defects**|1D|Dislocations in atom rows → enable ductility|
|**Surface Defects**|2D|Grain boundaries → influence crack spread and strength|

---

## 🛠️ **Using Defects for Better Materials**

Engineers **intentionally add defects** to improve material properties.

- **Tempered Glass**: Surface stress = shatter resistance.
- **Doping Silicon**: Adds boron/phosphorus → controls conductivity (semiconductors).
- **Alloying Steel**: Carbon atoms strengthen iron.

❗Example: Pure iron + carbon = **steel** (stronger & more useful)
