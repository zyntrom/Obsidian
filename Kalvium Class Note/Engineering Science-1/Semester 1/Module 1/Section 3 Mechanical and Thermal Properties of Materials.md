## 🛠️ **Mechanical Properties: Strength Under Stress**

### 💥 Stress & Strain

- **Stress** = Force / Area (unit: Pascal, Pa)
    - It’s the internal force experienced by a material.
- **Strain** = Change in length / Original length (unitless)
    - It’s how much the material deforms under stress.

### 📈 **Stress-Strain Curve**

|Region|Description|
|---|---|
|**Elastic Region**|Material returns to original shape|
|**Yield Point**|Permanent deformation begins|
|**Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)**|Max stress the material can handle|
|**Fracture Point**|Material breaks|

---

### 🧵 Elasticity vs. Plasticity

|Property|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Elasticity**|Temporary deformation|Rubber band|
|**Plasticity**|Permanent deformation|Bent paperclip|

---

### 🧱 Strength, Toughness & Hardness

|Property|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Yield Strength**|Resistance to permanent shape change|Steel frame|
|**Toughness**|Energy absorbed before fracture|Crash-resistant bumper|
|**Hardness**|Surface resistance to scratches/dents|Diamond tip tools|

---

### ⏳ Time-Dependent Behaviors

|Behavior|Cause|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Fatigue**|Repeated stress cycles|Airplane wings|
|**Creep**|Constant stress over time (especially at high temp)|Jet engine blades|

---

### 🔬 Internal Structure & Defects

- **Grain Size**: Smaller grains = stronger materials.
- **Crystal Structure**: Affects ductility, toughness.
- **Defects**: Dislocations allow deformation → affects strength.

✅ _Real-World Tip:_ Fine-grained metals are used in aerospace for strength.

## 🌡️ **Thermal Properties: Responding to Heat**

### 🔥 Thermal Conductivity

- **High conductivity**: Transfers heat easily → _Copper, Aluminum_
- **Low conductivity**: Resists heat transfer → _Wood, Plastic_

> Metals = good conductors  
> Insulators = poor conductors (used in handles, building insulation)

---

### 📏 Thermal Expansion

- Most materials **expand when heated**, **contract when cooled**.
- Measured using **coefficient of thermal expansion**.
- Bridges use **expansion joints** to prevent cracking.

---

### 🧪 Heat Capacity & Thermal Diffusivity

|Property|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Heat Capacity**|Heat needed to raise temp|Cast iron retains heat|
|**Thermal Diffusivity**|How fast a material changes temperature|Aluminum cools fast, heats fast|

---

### ⚠️ Thermal Stress & Shock

|Concept|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Thermal Stress**|Caused by uneven heating/cooling|Glass cracking with boiling water|
|**Thermal Shock Resistance**|Resistance to cracking under sudden temperature changes|Pyrex cookware|

## 🔍 Real-World Engineering Applications

### ✅ **Material Selection**

|Field|Material|Reason|
|---|---|---|
|Aerospace|Aluminum, carbon fiber|Strong + lightweight|
|Electronics|Copper, aluminum|High thermal/electrical conductivity|
|Construction|Foam, fiberglass|Good insulators|

---

### ❌ **Failure Case Studies**

|Case|Cause|
|---|---|
|**Tacoma Narrows Bridge**|Aerodynamic vibrations + material resonance|
|**Challenger Shuttle**|O-rings failed due to cold weather|

**Lesson:** Material behavior under real conditions is crucial for safety.
