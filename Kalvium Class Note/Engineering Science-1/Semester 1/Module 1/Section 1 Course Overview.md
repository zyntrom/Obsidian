### 🎂 **The Computer as a Layer Cake**

Each layer represents a level of abstraction:

1. **Materials** — Atoms, semiconductors (foundation).
2. **Components** — Transistors, resistors.
3. **Logic** — Logic gates, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).
4. **Architecture** — CPU, memory, system design.
5. **Language** — Machine code, assembly.

### ⚙️ **Material Science ↔ Electronics**

Every electronic device relies on **Material Science**:

- **Conductors (e.g., Copper):** Let current flow freely.
- **Insulators (e.g., Plastic, Glass):** Block current flow.
- **Semiconductors (e.g., Silicon):** Can act as both — based on external conditions.

#### ⭐ Key Concept: **Doping**

- Altering silicon by adding elements like **boron** or **phosphorus**.
- Controls conductivity.
- Enables creation of **transistors**, **logic gates**, and **processors**.
