## 🧪 What Is Material Testing?

Material testing = Testing materials under real-world stresses to evaluate:

- **Strength**
- **Durability**
- **Elasticity**
- **Surface hardness**

Why test materials?

- Ensure **safety** (bridges, planes, vehicles)
- Improve **design decisions**
- Meet **quality control standards**

## ⚙️ Key Mechanical Properties

|Property|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Tensile Strength**|Resistance to being pulled apart|Tug-of-war rope|
|**Hardness**|Resistance to surface deformation/scratching|Diamond|
|**Elasticity**|Returns to original shape after being stretched|Rubber band|
|**Plasticity**|Deforms permanently without breaking|Clay|

---

## 🧵 Tensile Testing

**Goal:** Understand how a material behaves under pulling (tensile) force

### ✅ Procedure:

1. Place material sample in tensile testing machine
2. Apply a **gradual pulling force**
3. Record **elongation** until the material breaks
4. Plot **Stress-Strain Curve**

### 📈 Interpreting Stress-Strain Curve:

- **Elastic region**: Material returns to original shape
- **Yield strength**: Point of permanent deformation
- **Ultimate tensile strength**: Max stress before necking
- **Fracture point**: Breaks

> Used in construction, aerospace, and automotive for **load-bearing parts**

## 🪨 Hardness Testing Techniques

![[Pasted image 20250711143411.png]]

**Goal:** Measure how resistant a material is to **indentation or scratching**

|Method|How it works|Best for|
|---|---|---|
|**Brinell**|Ball indenter, measure diameter of dent|Soft metals (aluminum, copper)|
|**Rockwell**|Depth of indentation, uses different indenters/loads|Heat-treated steel, fast and easy|
|**Vickers**|Diamond pyramid indenter, measure diagonals of tiny square dent|Thin materials, coatings, very hard surfaces|

Each test has its **own scale** and is chosen based on **material type and thickness**

---

## 🔍 Comparison of Testing Methods

|Test Type|Measures|Best For|Used In|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Tensile**|Strength, elasticity, ductility|Load-bearing materials|Bridges, aircraft, structural beams|
|**Hardness**|Surface durability, resistance to wear|Surface-treated components|Gears, bolts, wear parts|

> Engineers use both to ensure **core strength** + **surface durability**

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

![[Pasted image 20250711143434.png]]

- **Aerospace**: Ensures aircraft materials handle high stress + temperature
- **Automotive**: Checks strength of frames, hardness of engine parts
- **Construction**: Validates steel beams, cables, and load-bearing structures

Material testing = **Prevention of failure**, **quality control**, and **safety assurance**

---

## ⚠️ Safety in Testing Labs

- Always wear **PPE** (safety glasses, gloves)
- Follow lab **procedures and warnings**
- Be cautious around **machines, sharp tools, and high loads**

Lab safety = Protects you + ensures accurate test results
