## ⚡ Electrical Properties of Materials

### 🔌 **Types of Materials by Conductivity**

|Type|Behavior|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|**Conductors**|Allow electricity to flow easily|Copper, Aluminum, Silver|
|**Semiconductors**|Conductivity can be controlled|Silicon, Germanium|
|**Insulators**|Resist electricity|Rubber, Glass, Plastic|

💡 **Band Theory** explains these:

- **Conductors**: No energy gap between bands
- **Semiconductors**: Small, controllable gap
- **Insulators**: Large gap → electrons can't jump

### 🧠 **Resistivity, Resistance & Superconductivity**

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Resistance (R)**|Opposition to current; depends on material, length, area. Unit: ohms (Ω)|
|**Resistivity (ρ)**|Material’s inherent resistance (independent of shape). Unit: Ω·m|
|**Superconductivity**|Zero resistance at very low temps; used in Maglev trains, MRI machines, quantum computing|

🔌 Example:

- **Copper**: Low resistivity → ideal for wiring.
- **Nichrome**: High resistivity → used in heaters.
- **Superconductors**: Zero resistivity below critical temperatures → no energy loss!

### 🧲 **Dielectric Properties**

- **Dielectrics** don’t conduct electricity, but store electrical energy in an electric field.
- Used in **capacitors**.
- **Relative Permittivity (εr)**: Indicates how much energy a dielectric can store.
- Examples: Glass, mica, ceramic.

🔋 _Think of dielectrics as energy “sponges.”_

## 💡 Optical Properties of Materials

### 🌈 **Key Phenomena**

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|**Reflection**|Light bounces off surface (e.g. mirror)|
|**Refraction**|Light bends when passing into a material (e.g. lens, straw in water)|
|**Absorption**|Light is taken in, not passed through|
|**Transmission**|Light passes through the material (e.g. glass)|

🎨 **Transparency**:

- **Transparent**: Light passes through (glass)
- **Translucent**: Some light passes (frosted glass)
- **Opaque**: No light passes (wood)

### 🔍 **Refractive Index (n), Color, and Optoelectronics**

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Refractive Index (n)**|Bending of light; ratio of light speed in vacuum vs material|
|**Color**|Caused by selective absorption & reflection of wavelengths|
|**Photoconductivity**|Conductivity increases with light exposure (used in solar cells)|
|**Photoelectric Effect**|Light causes electrons to be emitted (used in light sensors)|
|**Optoelectronics**|Devices using both light and electricity|

🔦 **Examples**:

- **LEDs**: Emit light when current flows.
- **Lasers**: Emit focused, coherent light.
- **Photodetectors**: Detect light (e.g. in cameras, remotes).
