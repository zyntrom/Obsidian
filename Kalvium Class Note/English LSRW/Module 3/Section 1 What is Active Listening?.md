- Not just _hearing_, but _engaging_ with the speaker.
- Involves: **attention, feedback, remembering, and responding thoughtfully**.

### 🔹 Examples of Better Responses

❌ Speaker: “I’m worried about my presentation.”  
→ You: “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. I was nervous too.” (dismisses concern)

✅ Better: “What’s worrying you the most?” (opens space for deeper talk)
