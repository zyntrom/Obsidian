## ✈️ **What is Skimming?**

Skimming is like flying over a city in a helicopter: you don’t see every street, but you get the **big picture**.

When you **skim**, you:

- Focus on **titles, headings, subheadings**
- Read the **first and last sentences** of paragraphs
- Notice **bold, italicized**, or **highlighted** words

📌 **Purpose:** To **quickly understand** the overall meaning or main idea of a passage.

📖 **Example:**  
You’re reading an article titled _“New Study Shows Exercise Boosts Brainpower.”_  
Skim the **headlines**, **topic sentences**, and glance at a **graph** to get the idea—no need to read every line.

## 🔍 **What is Scanning?**

Scanning is like using a **metal detector on a beach**—you’re looking for something **specific**, not every grain of sand.

When you **scan**, you:

- Search for **names, dates, keywords, or statistics**
- Let your eyes **dart across the page** until you find what you need

📌 **Purpose:** To find **specific information** quickly.

📖 **Example:**  
You’re reading a menu and want to know the **price** of a dish. You **ignore the descriptions** and look directly where prices are listed.
