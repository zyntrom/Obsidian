## 🌟 Active Listening – Key Takeaways

### 🔹 What is Active Listening?

- Not just _hearing_, but _engaging_ with the speaker.
- Involves: **attention, feedback, remembering, and responding thoughtfully**.
- Like tuning a radio → you need clarity to fully understand.

1. **Understand your style** → Know your default listening approach.
2. **Conscious choice** → Focus on _speaker_, not on your own stories.
3. **Stay present** → Avoid zoning out, multitasking, or pre-planning responses.
4. **Withhold judgment** → Keep open mind, avoid interrupting.
5. **Reflect & validate** → Paraphrase, mirror feelings, show understanding.
6. **Clarify** → Ask open-ended questions (“Tell me more about…”).
7. **Summarize** → Restate key themes to confirm understanding.

### 🔹 Bad Listening Habits

- Zoning out.
- Checking phone while listening.
- Thinking of your reply before they finish.
- Interrupting or shifting focus to yourself.

### 🔹 Examples of Better Responses

❌ Speaker: “I’m worried about my presentation.”  
→ You: “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. I was nervous too.” (dismisses concern)

✅ Better: “What’s worrying you the most?” (opens space for deeper talk)

✅ **Active Listening = Awareness + Empathy + Engagement**
