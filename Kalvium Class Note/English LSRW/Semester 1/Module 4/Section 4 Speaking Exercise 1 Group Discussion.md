### 🧩 Preparation Tips

✅ **Clarify Your Viewpoint:**  
Decide your stance — _Do you believe success = wealth_, or do you value other measures (like happiness, purpose, relationships, or knowledge)?

✅ **Structure Your Argument:**  
Use a clear format:

- **Introduction:** Define “success.”
- **Body:** Present 2–3 reasons with examples.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize your stance confidently.

✅ **Anticipate Opposing Views:**  
Think about what others might say (e.g., “Money gives opportunities” or “True success is inner peace”) and plan short rebuttals.
