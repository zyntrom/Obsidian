## 🧠 **Kalvium – 1.5: The Structure of the Indian Government**

---

### **1️⃣ Introduction**

- Every digital rule — like UPI limits or app guidelines — comes from the **structure of the Indian Government**, which defines **who makes, enforces, and reviews laws**.
- This structure ensures **accountability, balance, and fairness**, especially for fast-evolving areas like **technology and data privacy**.

---

### **2️⃣ The Three Branches of Government**

India follows the **Separation of Powers** principle — dividing power among **three branches**:

1. **Legislature** – Makes the laws
2. **Executive** – Enforces the laws
3. **Judiciary** – Interprets and reviews the laws

👉 This avoids concentration of power and promotes **checks and balances** — each branch keeps the others in check.

---

### **3️⃣ A. The Legislature – Law-Making Body**

#### 🔹 Composition:

- **Parliament of India** (Articles **79–122** in Part V of the Constitution)
    - **President**
    - **Lok Sabha (House of the People)** – Members directly elected by citizens
    - **Rajya Sabha (Council of States)** – Members elected by State Legislative Assemblies

#### 🔹 Why Two Houses?

- **Checks & Balances:** Rajya Sabha reviews laws passed by Lok Sabha
- **Deeper Scrutiny:** Ensures more debate and diverse perspectives

#### 🔹 How a Bill Becomes a Law:

1. **Introduced & discussed in Lok Sabha** → voting
2. **Sent to Rajya Sabha** → further discussion & approval
3. **President’s Assent** → only then it becomes a **law**

#### 🔹 Example:

- The **Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000)** — first law defining cybercrimes like hacking and online fraud.
- The **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023** — debated and passed in Parliament.

#### 🧠 Did you know?

- The **President nominates 12 members** to the Rajya Sabha for their expertise in **literature, science, art, and social service**.

---

### **4️⃣ B. The Executive – Law-Enforcing Body**

Once Parliament passes laws, the **Executive** implements them.

#### 🔹 Includes:

- **President of India** – ceremonial Head of State; highest constitutional authority.
- **Prime Minister** – real head of government; leads **Council of Ministers**.
- **Government Ministries and Departments**, like:
    - **MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology)** – handles data protection, digital payments, and social media rules.

#### 🔹 Example:

If Parliament passes a law that apps must **ask user permission** before using the camera or microphone —  
👉 **MeitY** issues official **guidelines** and ensures compliance by companies like Google or Paytm.

#### 🧠 Did you know?

- The **President is elected indirectly** (by MPs and MLAs).
- **Council of Ministers**, led by the PM, helps in policy-making and governance.

### **5️⃣ C. The Judiciary – Law-Interpreting Body**

Ensures that **laws and government actions follow the Constitution** and protect citizens’ rights.

#### 🔹 Structure:

|Level|Courts|Key Function|
|---|---|---|
|**Top**|**Supreme Court**|Apex court; final authority; decisions binding nationwide|
|**Middle**|**High Courts**|Highest courts in each State/region|
|**Bottom**|**District & Local Courts**|Handle most civil and criminal cases at district level|

#### 🔹 Powers:

- Reviews laws and actions of the Legislature and Executive
- Can **strike down unconstitutional laws**
- Handles **Public Interest Litigations (PILs)** — cases filed for public good

#### 🧩 Example:

If a rule forces people to share location data 24/7 —  
👉 The Judiciary can declare it **unconstitutional**, protecting citizens’ **Right to Privacy (Article 21)**.

#### 🧠 Did you know?

- Citizens can file **PILs** directly in the High Court or Supreme Court.
- Example: PILs helped protect forests in Andhra Pradesh and fight pollution.

|**Executive**|Implements laws|Legislature questions actions, Judiciary reviews legality|
|**Judiciary**|Interprets laws|Legislature can amend laws within constitutional limits|

⚖️ This interconnected system ensures **no one branch becomes too powerful** — especially crucial for fast-moving sectors like **technology**.
