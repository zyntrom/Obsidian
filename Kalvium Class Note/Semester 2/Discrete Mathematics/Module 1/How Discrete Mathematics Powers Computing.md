# **Kalvium AL 1.1 – How Discrete Mathematics Powers Computing**

---

## 🧭 **1. Introduction — Where Math Meets Technology**

Discrete Mathematics forms the **logical and structural foundation** of computer science.  
It is the math that allows computers to **represent, process, and reason about information** in finite steps.

Real-world example → **Google Maps**

- Locations → **Nodes (Vertices)**
- Roads → **Edges (Connections)**
- Path calculation → **Graph Algorithms (like Dijkstra’s Algorithm)**

📍 **Insight:**  
Google Maps doesn’t just “know” the best path — it **computes** it using discrete mathematical models (graphs) and algorithms.

## 🧮 **2. What Is Discrete Mathematics?**

**Definition:**  
Discrete Mathematics deals with **separate, countable entities** — integers, symbols, logical statements, and finite structures — unlike continuous mathematics (calculus).

### 💡 Examples

- **0s and 1s** in binary code
- **Steps in algorithms**
- **Logic gates** in circuits
- **Graphs and trees** in networks
