## 🧠 Design for Developers — Lesson 3 Notes

**Lesson Title:** _Getting Started with Figma_  
**Module:** Why Design for Developers

---

### 🎨 Welcome to Design Tools!

In this lesson, you’ll begin **hands-on UI design** using Figma — a modern, collaborative design tool used by professionals across the industry.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Figma?

- ✅ **Free** for individual use
- 🌐 **Web-based** – no software installation required
- 🤝 Real-time collaboration (like Google Docs for design)
- ✨ Beginner-friendly interface and powerful tools

> Once you learn Figma, picking up other tools (like Sketch or Adobe XD) becomes much easier.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started with Figma

### ✅ Step 1: Create a Figma Account

- Go to [figma.com](https://figma.com)
- Sign up using email or Google account
- Access the **Figma Editor** from your browser or download the **Figma Desktop App** (optional)

---

## 🖥️ Figma's User Interface — 4 Key Sections

1. **Toolbar (Top)**
    - Tools: Move, Frame, Shape, Pen, Text, Hand, Comment
    - Common design actions: undo, zoom, export
2. **Layers Panel (Left Sidebar)**
    - View design elements in a hierarchy
    - Organize, group, rename, reorder, or lock elements
3. **Canvas (Center)**
    - Your main working area
    - Where you place, move, and edit your design components
4. **Properties Panel (Right Sidebar)**
    - Edit selected objects’ properties:
        - Size & Position
        - Colors: Fill / Stroke
        - Text settings
        - Layout & Effects

> Once you're comfortable with the UI, you’ll be able to quickly build and refine designs with precision.

## 🔺 Shape Tools — Building Blocks of Design

Figma provides a range of shape tools to start creating layouts and components:

- 🟦 Rectangle (R)
- ⚪ Ellipse (O)
- ➖ Line (L)
- 🔺 Polygon
- ⭐ Star

✅ You can resize, rotate, duplicate, and style each shape using the right sidebar.

🧠 _Tip:_ Combine basic shapes to create more complex elements like cards, buttons, input fields, etc.

---

## ✒️ Pen Tool & Vector Networks

The **Pen Tool (P)** is used to:

- Draw custom shapes and icons
- Create freeform curves or straight lines
- Build vector paths with anchor points

Figma’s **vector network** system is unique:

- Unlike traditional tools (which follow strict path chains), you can connect points in **multiple directions** — making it more flexible and powerful.

✅ Practice drawing icons, custom arrows, or abstract shapes using the Pen Tool.

---

## 📐 Constraints — Making Designs Responsive

Constraints control how design elements behave when frames (or screen sizes) change.

**Examples:**

- A button stays centered
- An icon stays pinned to the top-right corner
- A sidebar stretches or remains fixed in size

🔧 You’ll find **Constraints** in the right sidebar (once an element is selected).

Types of constraints:

- Left / Right / Top / Bottom
- Center
- Scale
- Fixed width or height

✅ Experiment with resizing frames to see how constrained elements behave.

> Mastering constraints is key to designing flexible, responsive interfaces for multiple screen sizes.

## ✅ Summary — What You’ve Learned

- How to **create a Figma account** and start a new design project
- Figma’s **interface layout** and what each panel does
- How to use **shape tools** to build layout elements
- Using the **Pen Tool** for advanced, custom design work
- Applying **constraints** to create responsive designs

🎯 These are your foundational design skills as a developer. With practice, you’ll be able to:

- Create UI mockups
- Convert wireframes into polished screens
- Collaborate better with designers
