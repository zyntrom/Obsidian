## 🎨 Building Visual Polish in Figma

After learning the basics of Figma’s interface and tools in the previous lesson, this lesson focuses on **visual design**, **alignment**, and **precision techniques** to make your interfaces look **clean, modern, and professional**.

---

### 🌈 1. Gradients — Adding Depth and Style

Gradients add richness and dimension beyond flat color fills.

**Gradient Types in Figma:**

- 🔁 Linear – Smooth transition from one color to another in a line
- 🌐 Radial – Transition radiating from a central point (like a glow)
- 🔄 Angular – Color transition that rotates around a central point
- 💎 Diamond – Transitions in a diamond shape

> 🎯 Use gradients to **highlight buttons**, **create depth in cards**, or **establish visual hierarchy**.

---

### 🎨 2. Color Picker — Choosing the Right Colors

Figma’s **color picker** allows you to:

- Select **solid colors**, **gradients**, or **image fills**
- Adjust **opacity and hex values**
- Use the **eyedropper tool** to pick colors from anywhere on the screen
- Create and manage **custom color styles** for consistent branding

> 🧠 Tip: Save reusable colors as **Styles** to ensure consistency across your design.

### 🔤 3. Text Tool & Fonts — Crafting Your UI Text

Text is one of the most important elements in UI design. In Figma, you can:

- Insert text using the **Text Tool (T)**
- Change:
    - **Font family, size, and weight**
    - **Line height (leading)** and **letter spacing**
    - **Alignment** (left, center, right)
    - **Text color** and **style**
- Choose from Google Fonts directly in Figma

> 🎯 Use heading, subheading, and paragraph styles for content hierarchy.

---

### 🖼️ 4. Working with Images — Making UI Realistic

In Figma, you can:

- **Import images** via drag-and-drop or `File → Place Image`
- Resize, crop, or rotate images
- **Mask images** into shapes (e.g., circular avatars)
- Replace placeholder images with real content (e.g., logos, icons, illustrations)

> 🧠 Tip: Use Unsplash, Icons8, or other Figma plugins to insert assets quickly.

---

### 📐 5. Alignment & Distribution — Creating Clean Layouts

Figma has built-in tools to **align and distribute** elements precisely:

- **Align** left, right, top, bottom, vertical center, or horizontal center
- **Distribute spacing** between multiple elements evenly
- Use **smart guides** and **snap-to-grid** for accuracy

> 🎯 Clean alignment improves **readability, balance, and professionalism**.

---

### 📏 6. Guides — Precision Layout Planning

Guides act like invisible rulers. You can:

- Drag **horizontal/vertical guides** from the top/left rulers
- Create **grids or columns** in frames (especially useful for responsive layouts)
- Lock guides and use them to align multiple UI components

> 🧠 Tip: Use guides to simulate margins, spacing rules, and layout grids.

---

### 🟦 7. Rounded Corners — Softening the Visual Feel

You can:

- Apply **uniform corner radius** to a shape (e.g., 10px)
    
- Customize **individual corners** (top-left: 0px, top-right: 20px, etc.)
    
- Round cards, buttons, images, or containers to enhance visual appeal
    

> 🎯 Rounded corners are part of modern, accessible, and touch-friendly UI design.
