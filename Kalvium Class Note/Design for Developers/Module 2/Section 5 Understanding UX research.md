## 🧠 **Psychology of Design – Summary**

> **Why do users abandon digital products?**  
> Because the product fails to **connect with users psychologically**. This module explores principles that help craft designs aligned with **how users think and behave**.

### 🔍 **Key Psychological Principles in UX**

---

### 🎯 **1. Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect)**

> “Make it stand out to make it stick.”

- Users remember the item that **stands out** among similar items.
- Differentiation can be achieved using:
    - **Color**
    - **Size**
    - **Shape**
    - **Motion**
    - **Orientation**

🟢 _Example_: A red apple among green ones or a highlighted pricing plan in a pricing table.

---

### 📝 **2. Serial Position Effect**

> “People remember the first and last things best.”

- **Primacy Effect**: First items are remembered better (long-term memory).
- **Recency Effect**: Last items are also memorable (short-term memory).

📱 _Example_: Navigation items like _Home_ and _Profile_ are placed at the ends of mobile app menus.

---

### ⚖️ **3. Hick’s Law**

> “More choices = Slower decisions.”

- **Decision time increases** with the number of options.
- Simplify user choices to increase efficiency.

📌 _Example_: Spotify lets users quickly choose their country code, avoiding a long list.

---

### 🧩 **4. Gestalt Principles**

> “Users seek patterns and structure.”

#### a) **Proximity**

- Objects placed close together are perceived as related.
    - _Example_: Button groups on BookMyShow.

#### b) **Similarity**

- Similar-looking items are grouped mentally.
    - _Example_: Consistent card layouts and icons on Airbnb.

#### c) **Closure**

- Incomplete figures are mentally completed by users.
    - _Example_: Incomplete letters in a design still form a recognizable word (Dribbble).

#### d) **Continuity**

- Users see continuous flow in connected elements.
    - _Example_: Candlestick chart patterns on TradingView.

#### e) **Symmetry & Asymmetry**

- **Symmetry** = balance, stability, aesthetic appeal.
- **Asymmetry** = attention-grabbing, emphasis.
    - _Example_: Apple uses symmetry for elegance.
    - _Example_: Effectlab uses asymmetry to draw focus to key content.

## 🧠 **Exercise**

Explore various websites and identify where and how they apply these psychological principles to:

- Improve usability
- Increase retention
- Enhance user satisfaction

Try answering:

- What stood out on first glance?
- What do you remember after leaving the site?
- Where did your eyes go first?

## 💬 **Key Takeaway**

> "Great UX isn’t just beautiful—it aligns with how the **human mind naturally works**."

Understanding these principles allows you to **predict**, **influence**, and **guide** user behavior in meaningful ways.
