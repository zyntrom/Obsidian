## 🧠 UX Research – Core Concepts

### 💡 Purpose of UX Research

- Understand **user behaviors, motivations, and needs**.
- Guide the **design process**.
- Make **informed decisions**, **validate assumptions**, and **iterate** effectively.

---

## 🧪 Types of UX Research (Based on Product Stage)

### 1. **Foundational Research** _(Before Design Phase)_

**Goal:** Understand users and their needs before designing the product.

#### 🔍 Methods:

- **User Interviews**:
    - _Structured_: Pre-set questions.
    - _Unstructured_: Free-flowing conversation.
    - ✔ Learn both answers and non-verbal cues.
- **Surveys**:
    - Wide reach; gather quantitative data.
    - Good survey design = valuable insights.
- **Focus Groups**:
    - Small group discussions led by a moderator.
    - Explore user perceptions and needs.
- **Competitive Audit**:
    - Analyze competitors to find gaps and align goals.
- **Field Studies**:
    - Observe users in their real environments (home/workplace).

### 2. **Design Research** _(During Design Phase)_

**Goal:** Improve and iterate designs using user input.

#### 🛠 Methods:

- **A/B Testing**:
    - Show users two versions of a design.
    - Choose the one with better user engagement/performance.
- **Card Sorting**:
    - Ask users to categorize items (e.g., car types).
    - Helps structure menus or navigation.
- **Guerrilla Testing**:
    - Quick, low-cost testing of prototypes with random users.
    - Fast feedback for early-stage designs.

---

### 3. **Post-Launch Research** _(After Product Launch)_

**Goal:** Measure real-world usage and improve based on results.

#### 📊 Methods:
- **A/B Testing** (again).
- **Surveys** (ongoing feedback).
- **Usability Testing**:
    - Evaluate ease of use.
    - Understand user frustrations and drop-off points.
- **User Log Analysis**:
    - Analyze logs for patterns, bugs, errors.
- **Observing Users**:
    - Watch users using the product or competitor’s.
    - E.g., Swiggy/Zomato using GoPros on delivery agents.

## 📈 Understanding UX Research Results

### 📌 What is User Research Analysis?

- Turning raw data ➝ _insights_.
- Involves classifying, organizing, and synthesizing data.

### 🕐 When to Analyze:

- **Start early**: Know what you're looking for before collecting data.
- **Periodic checks**: Avoid errors during the study.
- **Final analysis**: After data collection is done.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

- Jumping to conclusions.
- Organizing data poorly.
- Using only yes/no outcomes.
- Letting **biases** affect decisions.

## 🔍 Data Analysis: Quantitative vs Qualitative

|Type|Focus|Use For|
|---|---|---|
|Quantitative|Numbers, patterns, performance|Metrics, task success, behavior trends|
|Qualitative|Emotions, stories, user opinions|Context, motivations, hidden insights|

---

## 🧩 Steps for Analyzing UX Research

1. **Set goals** – What do you want to learn?
2. **Take notes immediately** after sessions.
3. **Review all data** – Identify patterns and themes.
4. **Organize data** – Label, tag, and categorize.
5. **Identify trends** – Link findings to research questions.
6. **Write recommendations** – Actionable insights for design.

## 🧠 Mindful of Biases in UX Research

### ❗ What are Biases?

- Unconscious distortions that affect how data is collected or interpreted.
- Based on assumptions, stereotypes, or emotions.

### ⚠️ Types of Biases:

|Bias Type|Explanation|How to Avoid|
|---|---|---|
|**Confirmation Bias**|Seeking only data that supports your assumptions|Ask open-ended questions, stay neutral|
|**False Consensus**|Believing others think like you|Diversify participants, challenge assumptions|
|**Recency Bias**|Giving more importance to recent info|Take detailed notes, review all sessions|
|**Primacy Bias**|Giving more importance to first info heard|Space out interviews, keep consistent structure|
|**Implicit Bias**|Stereotyping based on unconscious beliefs|Reflect on behavior, get external feedback|
|**Sunk Cost Fallacy**|Continuing with a bad design due to invested effort|Be open to change, use phased decision points|

---

## 🛡️ Preventing Bias in Research

- **Use neutral wording** in questions.
- **Encourage independent thinking**: Ask individuals before group discussions.
- **Avoid specific language**: Let users rate experiences freely.
- **Limit guidance**: Let users explore on their own.
- **Watch tone and body language**—but confirm interpretations.
- **Plan ahead**: Recruit users matching personas.
- **Stay open-minded**: Don’t anchor on early responses.

## 📝 Exercise Summary – Food Stall App

### 🎯 Objective:

Explore the feasibility of a **student volunteer food delivery app** within campus.

### ✅ Conduct:

- **Interview at least 5 students** (not your classmates).
- **Ask minimum 10 questions** (5 mandatory).
- **Document responses** and analyze trends.

### 🔑 5 Mandatory Questions:

1. How many meals per week do you eat _outside_ the hostel mess?
2. Which days do you prefer to eat out?
3. What types of food do you eat outside the mess?
4. Would you use an app to order from campus stalls with student volunteer delivery?
5. Would you pay a delivery fee? If yes, how much % of order value?
