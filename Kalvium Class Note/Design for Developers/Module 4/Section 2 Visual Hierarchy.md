# Visual Hierarchy – Notes

## Definition

- **Visual hierarchy** = arranging elements to show **order of importance**.
- Determines **where users focus first** and **what action to take**.
- Achieved using variations in **size, weight, colour, contrast**, etc.

---

## Key Ways to Introduce Visual Hierarchy

### 1. Emphasize Elements

- Avoid making everything compete for attention.
- Highlight **primary information** → de-emphasize secondary/tertiary.
- Result = cleaner, more appealing design without changing layout/fonts.

### 2. Effectively Use Size

- **Objects**: Larger = more noticeable. Variation establishes hierarchy.
    - Too many large elements reduce impact.
- **Text**: Larger size for titles/primary content → improves focus.

### 3. Effectively Use Weight

- Adjust **font weights** for emphasis.
- Example: Title or CTA button highlighted with heavier font.
- Recommended weights:
    - Normal → 400/500
    - Heavy → 600/700
    - Extra-heavy → 800/900

### 4. Effectively Use Colour & Contrast

- Vibrant colours attract more than dull/desaturated colours.
- **Contrast** = noticeable difference (size, colour, etc.) → emphasizes distinct elements.
- Tips:
    - Avoid readability issues (vibrant text on dark background).
    - Use desaturated backgrounds with vibrant borders.
    - De-emphasize unimportant items to emphasize the key element.

### 5. Using Contrast & Weight Together

- **Contrast to balance weight**:
    - Icons are “heavy.” Reduce contrast to make them lighter.
- **Weight to balance contrast**:
    - Increase weight (e.g., thicker border) when contrast cannot be adjusted.

### 6. Working with Labels

- Avoid **label:value** format → all elements appear equally important.
- **When to avoid labels**: If context makes meaning clear (e.g., phone, email).
- **Labels as secondary**: Keep focus on actual data, labels less prominent.
- **When to emphasize labels**: If users seek label info (e.g., specifications while buying a scooter).

### 7. Working with Buttons

- **Three button types**:
    - **Primary**: Solid background, most important.
    - **Secondary**: Outlined/desaturated, less prominent.
    - **Tertiary**: Text/link, discoverable but not obvious.
- Good design = clear button hierarchy → prevents user confusion.

## Summary

- Visual hierarchy guides users by **emphasizing important info** and reducing distractions.
- Tools for hierarchy: **Size, Weight, Colour, Contrast, Labels, Buttons**.
- Goal: Clear, balanced, user-friendly design.
