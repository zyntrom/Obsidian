# Typography – Notes

## Definition

- **Typography** = Art of arranging letters/text to make words **readable, visually compelling, and expressive**.
- Seen in branding, apps, newspapers, websites, etc.

## Typeface vs Font

- **Typeface**
    - Overall **design style** of letters, numbers, symbols.
    - Examples: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Garamond.
    - Attributes: shape, weight (bold/regular/light), serif or sans-serif.
- **Font**
    - Specific **variation/style** within a typeface family.
    - Examples: Arial Regular, Arial Bold, Arial Italic.
    - Defined by weight, slant, style.
- **Summary**:
    - Typeface = Family name.
    - Font = Family member with unique style.

## Choosing a Good Typeface

- Crucial because it affects:
    - **Tone, readability, visual appeal**.
    - User experience & brand perception.
- Must **enhance communication** and leave an impression.

---

## Type Scale

- **Type scale** = Pre-defined set of intervals for balanced font sizes.
- Too many font sizes = unorganized design.
- Without scale = inconsistencies + lower productivity.

### Choosing a Scale

1. **Modular Scale**
    - Ratio-based (e.g. 4:5, 2:3, golden ratio 1:1.616).
    - Applied on base size (e.g. 16px).
    - Cons: fractional sizes, limited options.
2. **Hand-crafted Scale**
    - Manually selected font sizes.
    - Flexible, practical.

**Note**: Always use **rem or px** for font sizes.

## Text & Fonts

- Typography elements: **typefaces, spacing, size, weight, contrast**.
- Criteria for choosing fonts:
    - **Generous x-height** (better readability).
    - **Distinguishable letterforms** (I vs l).
    - **Overall readability**.
    - **Flexible weights** (regular, bold, etc.).
    - Type: Serif vs Sans-serif.

---

## Line Length

- Best readability: **45–75 characters per line**.
- More than 75 → difficult.
- Even inside wider layouts, keep paragraphs limited in width.

---

## Alignment of Text

- **Left align** → default for languages like English.
- **Right align** → use for numbers/timestamps in tables/dashboards.
- **Center align** → short individual text blocks.
- **Justify** → enable hyphenation to reduce awkward gaps.
- **Baseline alignment** → align multiple font sizes to baseline (not vertical center).

---

## Line Height

- **Line height & line length**:
    - Wider paragraphs → larger line height.
    - Narrower paragraphs → smaller line height.
- **Line height & font size**:
    - Small text → larger line height (for readability).
    - Large text → smaller line height.

---

## Letter Spacing

- Adjust spacing to improve readability.
- **Headlines**: Decrease spacing for condensed look.
- **All caps**: Increase spacing (default spacing favors mixed case).

---

## Working with Links

- Links should **stand out and look clickable**.
- Subtle emphasis also works.
- States:
    - **Unvisited** → one style.
    - **Visited** → updated style (e.g. Google search).

# Quick Summary (for revision)

- Typography = art of arranging letters/text.
- Typeface = family | Font = variation.
- Good typeface → improves tone, readability, impression.
- Type scale = modular/hand-crafted.
- Fonts should be readable, distinguishable, flexible.
- Line length = 45–75 chars.
- Align text → left, right (numbers), center (short text), justify (with hyphenation).
- Line height: directly ∝ paragraph width, inversely ∝ font size.
- Letter spacing: adjust for headlines, increase for all caps.
- Links must stand out, with visited/unvisited states.
