# Layouts and Spacing – Notes

## 1. Layouts

- **Definition**: Arrangement and organisation of elements on a page or screen.
- **Purpose**: Create visually appealing and balanced designs.
- **Tools**: Spatial systems, grids, layouts.
- **Benefits**: Consistency, rhythm, alignment, better decision-making.

### Margins

- **Definition**: Space around the element (outside).
- **Analogy**: Space between paper edges and the element.
- **When to use**:
    - To create a gap/space around content block.
    - To make space between two elements.

### Padding

- **Definition**: Space between content and element’s edges (inside).
- **Analogy**: Space between text and border of a text box.
- **When to use**:
    - Create gap between container edges and content.
    - Increase size of content block (without increasing content size).
    - Example: Making a button larger → add padding.

## 2. Spacing

### Effective Use of Whitespace

- **Definition**: Empty area between and around elements. Can be any colour, texture, pattern, or image.
- **Significance**:
    - Improves text legibility.
    - Directs focus to important elements (e.g., “Grab your bite” button).
    - Provides clean, simple interface with more breathing room.
    - Compact designs with less whitespace can still work when needed.

### Spacing & Sizing System

- **Spatial system**: Set of rules for measuring, sizing, and spacing UI elements.
- **Example**: _8-point grid system_ → spacing based on multiples of 8.
    - Ensures consistency.
    - Simple to use and visually appealing.

### Avoid Ambiguous Spacing

- Leave **more space around groups** than within them.
- Helps establish **visual connection** between elements.
- Example: Proper spacing between bullet points makes reading easier.

## 3. Grids

- **Definition**: Framework to organise and present ideas clearly.
- **Most common type**: Column grids.
- **Standard use**:
    - Desktop → 12-column grid.
    - Mobile → 4-column grid.

### Pros of Grids

1. **Uniform layout** → separates and organises content clearly.
2. **Content flexibility** → easy to modify parts of a webpage.
3. **Easy site additions** → predefined layout allows smooth expansion.
4. **Device integration** → grid-based designs adapt easily to mobiles/tablets.

### Cons of Grids

1. **Stifled creativity** → boundaries limit unique designs.
2. **Loss of brand identity** → standard grids (e.g., 960 grid) reduce uniqueness.
3. **Cluttered design** → too much content in modules defeats purpose.

## 4. Content Width

- Sometimes better to **centre content** rather than making it full width.
