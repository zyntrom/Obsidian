# Visual Design Principles – Notes

## What Makes a Design Visually Appealing?

- Visually appealing design = **harmony, balance, clarity**.
- Good design is like a **well-composed painting/photograph** → grabs attention immediately.
- Effective use of **colors, shapes, fonts, and layouts** = message communicated effortlessly.
- Misaligned/poorly structured elements feel **unsettling** → our brains detect patterns, symmetry, and structure.

## Five Fundamental Principles of Visual Design

1. **Scale**
    - Use of relative size to show **importance**.
    - Larger elements = more attention, higher significance.
    - Guides viewer’s focus.
2. **Visual Hierarchy**
    - Arrangement of elements in **structured order of importance**.
    - Achieved by:
        - Size
        - Color
        - Spacing
        - Placement
    - Ensures **key information stands out**.
3. **Balance**
    - Distribution of elements to create **stability and harmony**.
    - Two types:
        - **Symmetrical** → evenly distributed elements.
        - **Asymmetrical** → contrasting elements arranged to maintain equilibrium.
4. **Contrast**
    - Use of differences (color, size, shape, texture).
    - Purpose:
        - Distinguish elements
        - Improve readability
        - Highlight important content
        - Add visual engagement
5. **Gestalt Principles**
    - Psychological concepts: people see visuals as a **whole**, not separate parts.
    - Helps create **organized, cohesive, and easily understood** designs.
