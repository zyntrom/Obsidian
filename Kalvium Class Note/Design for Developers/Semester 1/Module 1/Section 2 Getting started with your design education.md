## 💡 What Goes Into Designing a Digital Product?

Design is **not just decoration**. It’s about:

- Making experiences **intuitive**, **useful**, and **delightful**
- Solving real problems through thoughtful **structure**, **testing**, and **iteration**

📱 **Example: Apple Music App**

## 🎨 UI vs UX — What’s the Difference?

|Aspect|UI (User Interface)|UX (User Experience)|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Visual, interactive layer|Entire user journey|
|**Focus**|How it **looks**|How it **feels & works**|
|**Goal**|Functional & attractive design|Seamless, intuitive experience|
|**Examples**|Buttons, icons, layout, typography|User flow, satisfaction, task success|
|**Key Roles**|Visual designer, front-end dev|UX researcher, interaction designer|

### UX = The overall user **journey and satisfaction**

- User Research
- Information Architecture
- Usability Testing

### UI = The **visual touchpoints** users interact with

- Colors, fonts, layout
- Buttons, icons, spacing
- Interaction consistency

## 🧩 Introduction to Design Thinking

Design Thinking is a **problem-solving framework** that’s human-centered and iterative.

### The 5 Stages of Design Thinking:

1. **Empathize** – _Understand your users deeply_
    - Observe users, conduct interviews
    - Uncover real needs, behaviors, frustrations
2. **Define** – _Frame the core problem_
    - Synthesize insights from research
    - Write a clear problem statement
    - Example: “Young users feel overwhelmed by too many options on mobile apps.”
3. **Ideate** – _Brainstorm creative solutions_
    - Use mind maps, “How Might We” questions, and sketches
    - No idea is too crazy—quantity leads to quality
4. **Prototype** – _Make ideas tangible_
    - Create low-fidelity models (wireframes, sketches)
    - Focus on flow and feedback, not perfection
5. **Test** – _Learn from real users_
    - Observe how users interact with your prototype
    - Gather feedback and refine the design
    - Be ready to go back and iterate

> Design Thinking is **non-linear**—you can loop back to previous stages at any time.
