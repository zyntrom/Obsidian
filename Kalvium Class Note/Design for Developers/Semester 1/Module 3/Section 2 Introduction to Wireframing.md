## 6. Notes on Terminology

- Some contexts use **only two categories**: low-fidelity & high-fidelity.
- Often, "wireframe" = low-fidelity design, while detailed mockups are called **prototypes or mockups**.
- **Limitations**:
    - Low-fidelity: not great for usability testing (requires imagination).
    - High-fidelity: better for validation before development.
