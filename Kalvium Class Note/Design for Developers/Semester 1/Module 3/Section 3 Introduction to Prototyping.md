# Prototyping ‚Äì Notes

## 1. What are Prototypes?

- **Definition**:  
    A **prototype** is a **mid-to-high fidelity interactive model** of a product (website/app) that simulates the **final user experience**.
- **Difference from Wireframes**:
    - Wireframes = static blueprints.
    - Prototypes = interactive models (with animations, clickable elements, transitions).
- **Purpose**:
    - To **test usability** and refine user experience before development.
    - To simulate navigation flow and functionality realistically.

## 2. Benefits of Prototyping

1. **User Testing & Iteration** ‚Äì test with real users, collect feedback, improve before coding.
2. **Enhanced Interactivity** ‚Äì clickable elements, gestures, animations ‚Üí realistic experience.
3. **Better Collaboration** ‚Äì easy sharing and reviewing among designers, developers, and stakeholders.
4. **Integration with Testing Tools** ‚Äì prototypes work with usability testing platforms.
5. **Validates Concepts** ‚Äì ensures functionality and UX work well before development.

## 3. The Role of Prototyping

1. **Visualising Ideas** ‚Äì brings static concepts to life; easier to communicate ideas.
2. **Testing & Validation** ‚Äì early usability testing reveals issues before coding.
3. **User-Centered Design** ‚Äì helps designers design from the user‚Äôs perspective.
4. **Reducing Risks** ‚Äì identifies errors early, prevents costly redesigns.
5. **Client Communication** ‚Äì clients/stakeholders better understand with interactive prototypes.
6. **Design Documentation** ‚Äì clear reference for developers; avoids misinterpretation.

## 4. Types of Prototyping

### 1. **Paper Prototypes**

- Hand-drawn sketches on paper.
- **Advantages**:
    - Very cheap and fast.
    - Easy to iterate.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - No real interactivity.
    - Limited to simple UI ideas.

### 2. **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**

- Basic digital grayscale layouts with placeholder content.
- **Advantages**:
    - Cost-effective, quick to create.
    - Focus on UX & flow, not visuals.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Easy to misinterpret by clients/stakeholders.

### 3. **High-Fidelity Prototypes**

- Detailed, pixel-perfect, close to final product.
- Includes real content, images, typography, branding.
- **Advantages**:
    - Realistic ‚Üí accurate usability testing.
    - Effective for communication & final approvals.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Time-consuming and costly to create.
    - Resistance to change (too polished).

### 4. **Interactive Prototypes**

- Includes clickable elements, buttons, forms, menus, hover states.
- **Advantages**:
    - Realistic user testing experience.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Time-consuming for complex projects.

### 5. **Mobile App Prototypes**

- Prototypes designed specifically for mobile screens (gestures, touch/tap, responsive).
- **Advantages**:
    - User-centered, detects usability issues early.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Time-consuming and costly (requires tools + multiple devices).

## 5. How to Create Prototypes

- Steps (general):
    1. Start with wireframes.
    2. Add interactivity (clickable flows, transitions).
    3. Refine into high-fidelity designs.
    4. Test with users.
    5. Iterate based on feedback.
- Tools: **Figma, Adobe XD, InVision, Marvel, Axure**.

## 6. Mind Map (Quick Recap)

- **Prototype = Interactive Model** (vs wireframe = static).
- **Benefits** = User testing, better collaboration, risk reduction.
- **Role** = Visualisation, validation, documentation.
- **Types** = Paper ‚Üí Low-fidelity ‚Üí High-fidelity ‚Üí Interactive ‚Üí Mobile.
- **Creation** = Wireframe ‚Üí Interactivity ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Feedback ‚Üí Refinement.
