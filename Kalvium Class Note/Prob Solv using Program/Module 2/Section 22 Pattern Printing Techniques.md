### 📘 **Pattern Printing Techniques – Summary (SPE 2025)**

**Purpose:** Practice logic, nested loops, formatting, and output alignment.

#### 🔹 Pattern 1: Square Pattern

- **Code Logic:** 2 nested loops (rows × cols)
- **Python:**  
```python
    for i in range(n): 
	    for j in range(n): 
		    print("*", end="")
```
- **cpp:**  
```cpp    
for(i=0;i<n;i++) {
	for(j=0;j<n;j++) {
		cout << "*";
	}
}
```
- **Output:**
```
**** 
**** 
**** 
****
```

#### 🔹 Pattern 2: Pyramid Pattern

- **Code Logic:** 3 steps:
    
    1. Loop over rows
    2. Print spaces: `rows - i - 1`
    3. Print stars: `2*i + 1`
- **Python:** Uses `" " * n` and `"*"` in one `print()`
- **cpp:** Separate inner loops for spaces and stars

**Output:**

```
	   *   
	  ***  
     ***** 
    *******
```

#### ❗ Common Mistakes

- Forgetting `end=""` in Python
- Wrong space-star count
- Inner loop printing newline by mistake

#### 🧠 Tips

- Try changing number of rows
- Make right-aligned, inverted, or diamond shapes
