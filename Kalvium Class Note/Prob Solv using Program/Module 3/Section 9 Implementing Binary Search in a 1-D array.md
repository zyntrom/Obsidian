# ðŸ“˜ Notes: Binary Search in a 1-D Array

## ðŸ”¹ Definition

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm used on **sorted arrays**. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space into halves until the target element is found or the search space becomes empty.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Properties

- **Input Requirement**: Array must be sorted (ascending order in this case).
- **Time Complexity**:
    - Best Case: O(1) â†’ element found at first mid check
    - Worst Case: O(log n) â†’ search space halves each time
        
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) â†’ iterative implementation requires constant extra space

## ðŸ”¹ Working Principle (Step-by-Step)

1. Start with two pointers:
    
    - `low = 0` (start of array)
        
    - `high = n-1` (end of array)
        
2. Find the middle index:
    
    - `mid = (low + high) / 2` (integer division)
        
3. Compare `arr[mid]` with target `x`:
    
    - If `arr[mid] == x` â†’ return `mid` (found)
        
    - If `arr[mid] < x` â†’ move to **right half** (`low = mid + 1`)
        
    - If `arr[mid] > x` â†’ move to **left half** (`high = mid - 1`)
        
4. Repeat until `low > high` (search space exhausted).
    
5. If not found â†’ return `-1`.

## ðŸ”¹ Algorithm (Iterative)

`BinarySearch(arr, n, x):     low = 0     high = n - 1     while low <= high:         mid = (low + high) // 2         if arr[mid] == x:             return mid         else if arr[mid] < x:             low = mid + 1         else:             high = mid - 1     return -1`

## ðŸ”¹ Example

Array: `[2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56]`  
Target: `23`

Steps:

1. low = 0, high = 7 â†’ mid = 3 â†’ arr[3] = 12 < 23 â†’ search right half
    
2. low = 4, high = 7 â†’ mid = 5 â†’ arr[5] = 23 â†’ Found at index 5
    

**Answer = 5**

## ðŸ”¹ Advantages

- Much faster than Linear Search for large arrays.
    
- Time complexity O(log n).
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ Limitations

- Works only on **sorted arrays**.
    
- Not suitable for dynamic datasets (where elements are frequently inserted/deleted).
