### ☕ Real-Life Observation

Ever noticed…

- A **metal spoon** in tea feels ice cold on a winter morning?
    
- A **blanket** feels warm instantly?
    
- **Tiles in the sun** burn your feet, while shaded ones stay cool?
    

These everyday experiences are all governed by **heat and temperature**—invisible but powerful scientific principles shaping our lives and devices.

## 🔁 What Is Heat Transfer?

**Heat = energy in motion**, always trying to spread from hot to cold. It travels through **3 modes**:

|Mode|Medium Needed?|How it Works|Real-Life Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Conduction**|Solid|Heat travels through direct contact|Hot pan on stove, iron on clothes|
|**Convection**|Liquid/Gas|Heat travels via moving fluid particles|Boiling water, room heating, hot air balloon|
|**Radiation**|None (space)|Heat travels as **EM waves** (infrared)|Sunlight, fire warmth, infrared heaters|

---

### 🔩 **1. Conduction: Heat by Touch**

> **Definition**: Transfer of heat through **direct contact** in solids.

**Equation** (Fourier’s Law):  
`Q = (k × A × ΔT) / d`

- `Q`: Heat transfer rate (W)
    
- `k`: Thermal conductivity
    
- `A`: Cross-sectional area
    
- `ΔT`: Temperature difference
    
- `d`: Thickness
    

#### ✅ Examples:

- **Cooking**: Pan heating evenly on a stove
    
- **Computer Heat Sink**: Transfers CPU heat to surroundings
    
- **Ironing Clothes**: Hot plate presses heat into fabric
    
- **PCB Boards**: Copper tracks conduct electricity _and_ heat
    

---

### 🌬️ **2. Convection: Heat by Flowing Fluids**

> **Definition**: Transfer of heat through **movement of liquids or gases**.

**Equation** (Newton’s Law of Cooling):  
`Q = h × A × ΔT`

- `h`: Convection heat transfer coefficient
    
- `A`: Area
    
- `ΔT`: Temperature difference
    

#### ✅ Examples:

- **Data Centers**: Cool air circulates to remove server heat
    
- **Hot Air Balloons**: Heated air rises, lifting balloon
    
- **Room Radiators**: Warm air rises, cold air falls → cycle
    

---

### ☀️ **3. Radiation: Heat by Waves**

> **Definition**: Transfer of heat via **infrared radiation**, no medium needed.

**Equation** (Stefan–Boltzmann Law):  
`Q = ε × σ × A × (Tr⁴ − Tc⁴)`

- `ε`: Emissivity (0–1)
    
- `σ`: 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²·K⁴
    
- `A`: Area
    
- `Tr`: Radiating temp
    
- `Tc`: Surrounding temp
    

#### ✅ Examples:

- **Bonfire Warmth**: Heat reaches you without contact
    
- **Infrared Lamps**: Used in kitchens and outdoor heaters
    
- **Thermal Cameras**: Detect radiation from circuit boards

## 🌡️ Specific Heat: Why Do Materials Heat Differently?

> **Definition**: The **energy needed to raise 1 kg of material by 1°C**.

|Material|Specific Heat|Behavior|
|---|---|---|
|**Water**|High (4.18 J/g°C)|Heats up slowly, stores energy|
|**Metal**|Low|Heats up fast, cools fast|

✅ **Applications**:

- **Water** in car radiators
    
- **Sand** heats up faster than sea water at the beach

## ⚙️ Thermodynamics: The Rules of Heat and Energy

> “Thermo” = heat, “Dynamics” = motion → How heat **moves, changes, and affects energy**.

### 🔹 Zeroth Law: **Thermal Equilibrium**

If A = B and B = C, then A = C (All reach the same temp over time)

🧊 _Hot tea cools in room until same temp as air_

---

### 🔹 First Law: **Conservation of Energy**

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.

📝 Formula: `ΔU = Q − W`

- `Q`: Heat added
    
- `W`: Work done
    
- `ΔU`: Internal energy change
    

🔋 _Laptop battery stores energy, then uses it to power screen later_

---

### 🔹 Second Law: **Entropy Always Increases**

> Heat moves from hot → cold naturally, and energy conversions are never 100% efficient.

🧊 _Ice melts in a room, never forms by itself_

🧹 _Your clean room gets messy unless you clean it again_

---

### 🔹 Third Law: **Perfect Order at Absolute Zero**

> At 0 K (−273.15°C), entropy becomes zero — no movement.

💎 _Perfect crystal = perfectly ordered structure_
