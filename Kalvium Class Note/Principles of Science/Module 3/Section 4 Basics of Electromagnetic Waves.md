# Notes: Basics of Electromagnetic Waves (SPE 2025)

## 1. What are Electromagnetic Waves?

- **Definition**: Disturbances in **electric and magnetic fields** that transport energy through space.
- **Formation**:
    - **Stationary charge** → produces only an electric field.
    - **Moving charge (current)** → produces both electric & magnetic fields.
    - **Accelerating charge** → produces a self-sustaining **electromagnetic wave**.
- **Key Point**: EM waves can travel in a **vacuum** (no medium required).
- **Examples**: Radio signals, visible light, X-rays.

## 2. Speed, Frequency, and Wavelength Relationship

- Formula:  
    **c = f × λ**
    - c = speed of light (≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum)
    - f = frequency (Hz)
    - λ = wavelength (m)
- **Example**:  
    Frequency f = 100 MHz = 100 × 10⁶ Hz  
    λ = c / f  
    λ = (3 × 10⁸) / (100 × 10⁶)  
    λ = 3 m
    
- **Problems**:
    1. Radio wave with f = 100 MHz → λ = 3 m
    2. λ = 0.5 m → f = (3 × 10⁸) / 0.5 = 6 × 10⁸ Hz

## 3. Unique Properties of EM Waves

- **Speed**: Constant in vacuum (≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s).
- **No Medium Required**: Can travel through space (unlike sound waves).
- **Energy Transmission**: Carry energy; higher frequency = more energy.
- **Analogy**:
    - Speed of light = "universal speed limit".
    - EM waves like solar panels → capture and transfer energy.

## 4. Electromagnetic Spectrum

- **Definition**: Full range of all frequencies of EM radiation.
- **Categories & Applications**:
    - **Radio Waves**: Longest λ, lowest f → radio, TV, wireless comms.
    - **Microwaves**: Radar, ovens, satellite comms.
    - **Infrared (IR)**: Heat radiation → remotes, thermal imaging.
    - **Visible Light**: Human vision → rainbow spectrum.
    - **Ultraviolet (UV)**: Sterilization, tanning, sunburn risk.
    - **X-Rays**: Medical imaging → bones, internal organs.
    - **Gamma Rays**: Nuclear reactions → cancer treatment, very high energy.

## 5. Summary / Recap

- EM Waves: Oscillating electric + magnetic fields, self-propagating.
- Properties: Travel at speed of light, no medium needed, carry energy.
- Equation: **c = f × λ** links speed, frequency, wavelength.
- Spectrum: Radio → Microwaves → Infrared → Visible → UV → X-rays → Gamma.
