# ðŸ“˜ Study Notes: _Sound Waves in Audio Devices_

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. How is Sound Produced?

- **Sound starts with vibration**: tuning fork, vocal cords, guitar string, etc.
- Vibrations disturb nearby particles â†’ form **waves**.
- **Sound = Mechanical Wave** (needs medium).
    - Air â†’ speech, music
    - Water â†’ underwater sounds
    - Solids â†’ knocks through walls
- **In vacuum**: No particles â†’ no sound.
- **Type of wave**: **Longitudinal** (particles move back & forth, parallel to wave).
    - **Compression** = particles close together (high pressure).
    - **Rarefaction** = particles spread apart (low pressure).

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Speed of Sound in Media

- Depends on **medium** (closer particles â†’ faster transfer).

|Medium|Speed of Sound (approx.)|
|---|---|
|Air|343 m/s|
|Water|1,480 m/s|
|Steel|5,960 m/s|

- **Solids > Liquids > Gases**

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Frequency & Amplitude in Sound

- **Frequency (Hz)** â†’ Pitch
    - High frequency = high pitch (whistle)
    - Low frequency = low pitch (drum)
- **Amplitude** â†’ Loudness
    - High amplitude = loud (concert, siren)
    - Low amplitude = soft (whisper, leaves rustling)

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Sound as Energy

- Sound = energy carried by vibrations.
- **Sound Intensity (I)** = energy flow per unit area per unit time.
- Formula:
![[Pasted image 20250826002152.png]]
    - PPP = sound power (W)
    - AAA = area (mÂ²)
- Intensity â†“ as distance â†‘ (energy spreads out).
    - Analogy: Light bulb dimmer with distance.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Factors Affecting Speed of Sound

1. **Temperature** â†‘ â†’ speed â†‘ (particles vibrate faster).
2. **Density** â†‘ â†’ speed â†“ (resists motion).
3. **Elasticity** â†‘ â†’ speed â†‘ (returns to shape quickly).

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Bluetooth Sound Transmission (Step-by-step)

1. **Analog â†’ Digital Conversion (ADC)**
    - Voice/music converted to binary data.
2. **Compression & Encoding**
    - Codecs (SBC, AAC, aptX) shrink file size.
3. **Modulation & Transmission**
    - Digital signal modulated onto Bluetooth wave.
    - Uses **FHSS** (frequency hopping) to avoid interference.
4. **Reception & Demodulation**
    - Earbuds capture wave â†’ extract digital audio.
5. **Digital â†’ Analog Conversion (DAC)**
    - Converted back to analog â†’ sound in speakers.

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Self-Paced Simulation Activity

- Change **Amplitude** â†’ affects **loudness**.
- Change **Frequency** â†’ affects **pitch**.
- Observation:
    - Amplitude â†‘ â†’ louder sound.
    - Frequency â†‘ â†’ higher pitch.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

- Sound = **mechanical longitudinal wave** â†’ requires medium.
- **Pitch** depends on frequency, **loudness** on amplitude.
- Sound intensity (W/mÂ²) decreases with distance.
- Speed of sound depends on **medium properties** (T, density, elasticity).
- Modern devices (Bluetooth, speakers, calls) rely on **conversion, compression, modulation, filtering** for sound transmission.
