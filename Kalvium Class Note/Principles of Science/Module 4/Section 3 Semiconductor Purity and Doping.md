# Semiconductors – Purity and Doping

## 1. What is a Semiconductor?

- **Definition**: Material with electrical conductivity between conductors (high conductivity) and insulators (no conductivity).
- **Examples**: Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Gallium arsenide (GaAs).
- **Most used**: Silicon (abundant, stable, forms base for microchips).
- **Role**: Backbone of all modern electronics (processors, diodes, transistors, microchips).
- **Analogy**: Works like a “traffic controller” for electric current.

## 2. Why Semiconductors are Special

- Conductivity depends on **conditions** (temperature, impurities, applied voltage).
- Can be engineered to act as a **conductor or insulator** when needed → ideal for logic circuits.
- Governed by **band gap** (small gap between valence band & conduction band):
    - **Conductor** → bands overlap (easy flow).
    - **Insulator** → large band gap (no flow).
    - **Semiconductor** → small band gap (flow possible under control).

## 3. Types of Semiconductors

### A. Intrinsic Semiconductor (Pure)

- **Definition**: Pure material (e.g., silicon without impurities).
- **Properties**:
    - Very weak conductivity.
    - Limited number of charge carriers (few electrons & holes).
- **Use**: Base material for making useful semiconductors.
- **Analogy**: Blank canvas → not useful alone, but essential for building.

### B. Extrinsic Semiconductor (Doped)

- **Definition**: Semiconductor with small, controlled impurities added → improved conductivity.
- **Process**: _Doping_.
- **Types**:

1. **N-type (Negative)**
    - Doped with **pentavalent impurity** (5 valence electrons, e.g., Phosphorus, Arsenic).
    - Extra electron becomes a **free charge carrier**.
    - Conductivity due to **electrons**.
2. **P-type (Positive)**
    - Doped with **trivalent impurity** (3 valence electrons, e.g., Boron, Gallium).
    - Creates **holes** (absence of electrons).
    - Conductivity due to **holes (positive carriers)**.

## 4. PN Junction

- Formed by joining **P-type** and **N-type** semiconductors.
- **Applications**:
    - **Diode**: Allows current in one direction only.
    - **Transistor**: Switches/amplifies signals.
- Foundation of digital logic & microprocessors.

## 5. Challenges of Doping

### 1. Dopant Movement (Diffusion at High Temperatures)

- **Problem**: Dopant atoms can move out of place when heated → performance drops.
- **Solution**: Low-temperature processing, barrier layers.

### 2. Impurity Scattering (Collisions)

- **Problem**: Extra dopant atoms scatter moving electrons/holes → reduces conductivity & speed.
- **Solution**: Controlled doping levels (balance between conductivity & scattering).

## 6. Analogy: Salt in Water

- **Pure water**: Poor conductor (no free ions).
- **Salt added**: Dissociates into Na⁺ & Cl⁻ ions → makes water conductive.
- **Comparison**:
    - Pure silicon = pure water (few charge carriers).
    - Doped silicon = saltwater (many charge carriers).
- **Key idea**: Impurities introduce free carriers, enabling conduction.

## 7. Relevance to Computer Science & Engineering

- Semiconductors form the **core of all electronics**:
    - **Processors & memory chips** → built from billions of transistors.
    - **AI hardware, smartphones, laptops, washing machines, IoT devices**.
    - Enable **switching, decision-making, and signal processing** at microscopic scale.

## 8. Summary (Quick Revision)

- **Semiconductors** → materials with conductivity between conductors & insulators.
- **Intrinsic** = pure, weak conductor.
- **Extrinsic** = doped, strong conductor.
- **Doping**:
    - N-type → adds electrons (pentavalent).
    - P-type → adds holes (trivalent).
- **PN junctions** → key to diodes & transistors.
- **Challenges**: dopant diffusion & impurity scattering.
- **Analogy**: Doping in semiconductors ≈ adding salt to water for conduction.
