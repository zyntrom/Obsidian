# Chemical Bonds and Molecular Interactions – Notes

## 1. Valence Electrons & Octet Rule

- **Valence electrons** → electrons in the outermost shell of an atom.
- **Octet Rule**: Atoms are most stable when they have 8 electrons in their outer shell.
- Noble gases are unreactive because they already satisfy the octet rule.
- **Shell capacity formula**:  
    Max electrons = 2n² (where _n_ = shell number).  
    Example:
    - 1st shell (n=1) → 2 electrons
    - 2nd shell (n=2) → 8 electrons

## 2. What Are Chemical Bonds?

- **Definition**: Attractive forces holding atoms/ions together, leading to stable compounds by lowering overall energy.
- **Analogy**: Like LEGO blocks connecting to form structures.

## 3. Types of Chemical Bonds

### A. Ionic Bonds (Electron Transfer)

- **Process**: Metal donates electron(s) → becomes cation (+); nonmetal accepts electron(s) → becomes anion (–).
- Opposite charges attract strongly → ionic bond.
- **Properties**:
    - High melting/boiling points (strong forces).
    - Conduct electricity when dissolved in water (ions move freely).
- **Example**: NaCl (table salt).
    - Na → Na⁺ (loses 1e⁻)
    - Cl → Cl⁻ (gains 1e⁻)
    - Attraction forms NaCl.

### B. Covalent Bonds (Electron Sharing)

- **Process**: Two nonmetals share electrons to complete octet.
- **Properties**:
    - Can be polar (unequal sharing) or nonpolar (equal sharing).
    - Lower melting/boiling points than ionic compounds.
- **Example**: H₂O (water).
    - Oxygen shares 2 electrons (1 each with 2 hydrogens).
    - Each atom achieves stable configuration.

### C. Metallic Bonds (Electron Pooling)

- **Process**: Metal atoms contribute electrons to a "sea of electrons".
- Positive ions surrounded by free-moving electrons.
- **Properties**:
    - Good conductors of electricity (electrons move freely).
    - Malleable & ductile (atoms can slide without breaking bonds).
    - Shiny/lustrous surface.
- **Example**: Copper (Cu).

## 4. Lewis Structures (Electron Dot Structures)

- **Purpose**: Show bonding & electron distribution (shared pairs + lone pairs).
- **Steps**:
    1. Count total valence electrons.
        
    2. Write skeletal structure.
        
    3. Place single bonds (shared pairs).
        
    4. Distribute remaining electrons to satisfy octet.
        
    5. If octet not satisfied → form double/triple bonds.
        
- **Example**: CO₂
    
    - C = 4e⁻, O = 6e⁻ × 2 = 12e⁻ → total 16e⁻.
        
    - Skeletal: O–C–O.
        
    - Adjust → :O=C=O: (each atom has octet).

## 5. VSEPR Theory (Molecular Shapes)

- **Full form**: Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion.
    
- **Principle**: Electron pairs repel and arrange as far apart as possible → determines molecular shape.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - CO₂ → Linear (180°).
        
    - H₂O → Bent (104.5°).
        
    - CH₄ → Tetrahedral (109.5°).

## 6. Electronegativity & Polarity

- **Electronegativity**: Ability of an atom to attract electrons in a bond.
    
- **Bond types**:
    
    - **Nonpolar covalent** → equal sharing (Cl₂).
        
    - **Polar covalent** → unequal sharing, partial charges (HCl).
        
- **Analogy**: Tug-of-war → stronger atom pulls electrons closer.
    

---

## 7. Intermolecular Forces (Forces Between Molecules)

- **Weaker than bonds**, but affect physical properties (melting point, boiling point, solubility).
    
- **Types**:
    
    1. **Hydrogen Bonding** (strongest IMF)
        
        - Occurs when H is bonded to highly electronegative atom (N, O, F).
            
        - Example: H₂O molecules stick together → high boiling point.
            
    2. **Dipole-Dipole Forces**
        
        - Between polar molecules.
            
        - Example: HCl.
            
    3. **London Dispersion Forces (Van der Waals)**
        
        - Weak, present in all molecules (temporary dipoles).
            
        - Example: noble gases, nonpolar molecules.

## 8. Summary (Quick Revision)

- **Valence electrons + Octet Rule** → stability concept.
    
- **Types of bonds**:
    
    - Ionic = electron transfer, strong, conductors.
        
    - Covalent = electron sharing, polar/nonpolar, weaker than ionic.
        
    - Metallic = electron sea, conductors, malleable.
        
- **Lewis structures** → bonding + lone pairs.
    
- **VSEPR theory** → predicts 3D shapes of molecules.
    
- **Electronegativity** → determines polar vs nonpolar bonds.
    
- **Intermolecular forces** → hydrogen bonding > dipole-dipole > London dispersion.
