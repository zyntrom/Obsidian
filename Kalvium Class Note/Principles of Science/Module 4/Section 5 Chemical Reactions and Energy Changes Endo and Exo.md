# Chemical Reactions and Energy Changes

## What is a Chemical Reaction?

- A chemical reaction = rearrangement of atoms where old bonds break and new ones form → producing new substances with different properties.
- Analogy: baking a cake → raw ingredients (reactants) combine to form a completely new product (cake).

### Key Terms:

- **Reactants** → Starting substances (ingredients).
- **Products** → New substances formed.
- **Catalyst** → Speeds up a reaction by lowering activation energy; not consumed.

## Signs of a Chemical Reaction

1. **Color change** → apple browning.
2. **Gas formation** → bubbles when vinegar + baking soda react.
3. **Temperature change** → quicklime + water releases heat.
4. **Precipitate formation** → limescale from boiling hard water.

## Types of Chemical Reactions

1. **Synthesis (Combination):**  
    A + B → AB  
    Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
2. **Decomposition:**  
    AB → A + B  
    Example: 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂
3. **Single Displacement:**  
    A + BC → AC + B  
    Example: Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂
4. **Double Displacement:**  
    AB + CD → AD + CB  
    Example: NaCl + AgNO₃ → AgCl + NaNO₃
5. **Combustion:**  
    Fuel + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + Energy  
    Example: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O

## Energy Changes in Reactions

- Reactions involve **bond breaking** (requires energy) and **bond formation** (releases energy).
- Net energy change decides if reaction is **exothermic** or **endothermic**.

### 1. Exothermic Reactions

- **Definition:** Release energy (heat/light) into surroundings.
- General form: Reactants → Products + Energy
- **Examples:**
    - Combustion (burning wood, fuels).
    - Respiration (glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + energy).
    - Freezing water into ice.

### 2. Endothermic Reactions

- **Definition:** Absorb energy from surroundings → surroundings feel cooler.
- General form: Reactants + Energy → Products
- **Examples:**
    - Photosynthesis (plants absorb sunlight).
    - Melting ice (absorbs heat).
    - Evaporation (absorbs energy from surroundings).

## Bond Energy and ΔH

- **ΔH = Energy absorbed (bond breaking) – Energy released (bond formation)**
- If ΔH < 0 → Exothermic (releases energy).
- If ΔH > 0 → Endothermic (absorbs energy).

---

## Summary

- **Chemical reactions** = atoms rearranging to form new substances.
- **Signs**: color change, gas, temperature, precipitate.
- **Types**: Synthesis, Decomposition, Single & Double Displacement, Combustion.
- **Energy changes**:
    - Exothermic → release heat (burning, respiration, freezing).
    - Endothermic → absorb heat (photosynthesis, melting, evaporation).
- **Bond energy (ΔH)** determines net energy flow.
