# Catalyst and its Reaction Mechanism

## 1. What is Catalysis?

- **Definition**: Process of increasing the rate of a chemical reaction by adding a _catalyst_, which is not consumed in the reaction.
- **Key idea**: Catalyst lowers _activation energy (Ea)_, providing an easier pathway for the reaction.
- **Analogy**: Like opening a shortcut lane in traffic—same destination, faster route.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Catalyst remains unchanged after the reaction.
    - Small amounts are very effective.
    - Makes processes faster and more energy-efficient.

## 2. Types of Catalysis

### a) Homogeneous Catalysis

- Catalyst and reactants in **same phase** (solid, liquid, or gas).
- **Example**:
    - _Esterification_: Ethanol + Acetic Acid → Ester (H₂SO₄ as catalyst).
    - Acid-Base catalysis: H⁺ ions transfer.
- **Analogy**: Food coloring mixing in water.

### b) Heterogeneous Catalysis

- Catalyst and reactants in **different phases** (usually solid catalyst with gas/liquid reactants).
- **Examples**:
    - Haber Process: N₂ + H₂ → NH₃ (Iron catalyst).
    - Catalytic converters in cars: Platinum converts CO → CO₂.
- **Analogy**: Charcoal filtering water without dissolving.

## 3. Classification of Catalysts

| Type                                  | Definition                                                     | Analogy                               | Example                                     | Applications                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Positive Catalysts (Accelerators)** | Increase rate by lowering activation energy.                   | Helper pushes a bicycle uphill.       | Iron in Haber Process (N₂ + H₂ → NH₃)       | Petroleum refining, polymerization, enzymes in cells |
| **Negative Catalysts (Inhibitors)**   | Slow down reaction by raising activation energy.               | Speed breaker slows vehicles.         | Acetanilide in H₂O₂ decomposition           | Food preservation, prevent unwanted reactions        |
| **Promoters**                         | Substances that enhance catalyst efficiency.                   | Fitness trainer improves performance. | Mo in Haber Process (improves Fe₂O₃)        | Fuel cells, petrochemical industry                   |
| **Catalyst Poisons**                  | Substances that deactivate catalysts by blocking active sites. | Glue in a keyhole blocks the key.     | BaSO₄ deactivating Pd in Lindlar’s catalyst | Selective hydrogenation, fuel processing             |

## 4. Units for Catalyst Efficiency

- **Katal (SI Unit)** → mol/s (catalytic activity).
- **Turnover Number (TON)** → number of molecules converted per catalyst molecule.
- **Turnover Frequency (TOF)** → turnovers per second (s⁻¹).
- **Enzyme Unit** → µmol/min (biological catalysis).

## 5. Enzyme Catalysis

- **Definition**: Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions.
- **Properties**: Highly specific, efficient, mild conditions.
- **Applications**: Medicine, biotechnology, food, environment.

### Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

- **Temperature**:
    - Optimum ≈ 37°C.
    - > 50°C: Denaturation.
    - <10°C: Slows down.
- **pH**:
    - Optimum ≈ 7 (neutral).
    - Enzyme-specific (Pepsin pH 2, Trypsin pH 8).
- **Substrate Concentration**:
    - Low: Slow rate.
    - High: Increases until saturation.
- **Inhibitors**:
    - _Competitive_: Bind active site (e.g., Penicillin).
    - _Non-competitive_: Bind elsewhere, distort enzyme (e.g., Lead).

## 6. Catalytic Mechanism (General Steps)

1. **Adsorption** – Reactants attach to catalyst surface.
2. **Activation** – Bonds weaken/break.
3. **Reaction** – New bonds form → products.
4. **Desorption** – Products released, catalyst reused.

- **Equation**: Arrhenius law → _k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)_
    - Catalyst ↓ Ea → k ↑ → faster reaction.
- **Example**: Platinum in catalytic converter:
    - 2CO + O₂ → 2CO₂

## 7. Biological Applications of Enzyme Catalysis

1. **Digestion** → Amylase breaks starch → sugars.
2. **Energy Production** → Cytochrome c oxidase → ATP.
3. **DNA Replication** → DNA polymerase → cell growth/repair.
4. **Medical** → Glucose oxidase in diabetes strips.
5. **Industrial** → Proteases in detergents for stain removal.
