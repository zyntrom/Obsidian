# Redox Reactions and Electrochemistry

## 1. Oxidation Number

- **Definition**: A way to track electron transfer by assigning charges.
- **Rules**:
    - Free element → 0 (e.g., Na, Cl₂).
    - Hydrogen → +1 (except in hydrides).
    - Oxygen → –2 (except in peroxides).
    - Halogens → –1 (usually).
    - Sum of oxidation numbers = net charge of compound/ion.

**Example**: 2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl

- Na: 0 → +1 (oxidized).
- Cl: 0 → –1 (reduced).

## 2. Oxidation

- **Definition**: Loss of electrons (increase in oxidation number).
- **Equation**: Na → Na⁺ + e⁻
- **Example**:
    - Rusting of iron → Fe → Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻

**Oxidizing Agent** = Accepts electrons, gets reduced.

- Common: O₂, Cl₂, H₂O₂

---

## 3. Reduction

- **Definition**: Gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation number).
- **Equation**: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu
- **Example**: Electroplating → Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag

**Reducing Agent** = Donates electrons, gets oxidized.

- Common: H₂, Na, CO

---

## 4. Redox Reactions

- **Definition**: Reactions where oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously.
- **Oxidation = Loss of electrons**
- **Reduction = Gain of electrons**

**Example**: 2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl

- Na oxidized → Na⁺
- Cl₂ reduced → Cl⁻

### Half-Reactions

- Oxidation half: Na → Na⁺ + e⁻
- Reduction half: Cl₂ + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻

## 5. Electrochemistry

- **Definition**: Study of relationship between electrical energy and chemical reactions.
- **Electrochemical cell**: Device converting chemical ↔ electrical energy.
- Two types:
    1. **Galvanic Cell (Voltaic)** → Spontaneous redox → electricity.
        - Examples: Batteries (AA, lithium-ion, lead-acid), fuel cells, rusting.
    2. **Electrolytic Cell** → Electricity drives non-spontaneous redox.
        - Examples: Electroplating, electrolysis of water, metal extraction, charging batteries.

## 6. Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis

### First Law

- Mass (m) of substance ∝ Quantity of charge (Q).
- Formula: m = (Q × M) / (n × F)
    - m = mass (g)
    - Q = charge (coulombs) = Current (A) × Time (s)
    - M = molar mass (g/mol)
    - n = electrons per ion
    - F = Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol)

### Second Law

- For same charge, masses of different substances ∝ their equivalent weights.

**Example Problem**  
Current = 2A, Time = 1h, Electrolyte = CuSO₄

- Q = 2 × 3600 = 7200 C
- Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (n = 2)
- m = (7200 × 63.55) / (2 × 96485) = 2.37 g  
    → 2.37 g copper deposited

## 7. Applications

- **Galvanic Cells** → Batteries, fuel cells, sensors.
- **Electrolytic Cells** → Electroplating, water electrolysis, industrial chlorine, rechargeable batteries.
- **Faraday’s Laws** → Predicting mass of substance in electrolysis.

## 8. Summary

- **Oxidation** = loss of electrons; **Reduction** = gain of electrons.
- **Oxidizing agents** → accept electrons; **Reducing agents** → donate electrons.
- **Redox reactions** always involve both oxidation + reduction.
- **Electrochemistry** → links chemical reactions with electricity.
    - Galvanic: produces electricity.
    - Electrolytic: consumes electricity.
- **Faraday’s Laws** → Quantitative relation between charge and mass deposited.
