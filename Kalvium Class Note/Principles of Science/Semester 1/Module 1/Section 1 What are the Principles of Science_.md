## üß† **How Does Science Shape Your Day?**

---

### üéØ **Lesson Objectives**

- Understand what science really is
- Explore why scientific knowledge is essential for computer science students
- Get an overview of key modules: physics, chemistry, and their role in daily life and technology

---

### üî¨ **What is Science?**

- **Science** is not just a subject‚Äîit‚Äôs a method of understanding how the world works.
- It's in everyday moments:
    - Your alarm clock = electricity + magnetism
    - Toothpaste = chemical compound
    - Toast = chemical reaction (browning via Maillard reaction)

> üß† **Definition**: Science is the study of matter, energy, and their interactions through observation, experimentation, and reasoning.

### üë®‚Äçüíª **Why Should a Computer Science Student Learn Science?**

- **Science = Foundation of Technology**
    
    - Hardware (chips, batteries, sensors) all depend on physical & chemical principles.
    - Knowing science lets you innovate better in design, performance, and problem-solving.

> üí° Like knowing the ingredients in a recipe‚Äîyou can't improve the output unless you understand what goes in.
