| **State**  | **Properties**                                                  | **Examples**                 | **Scientific Application**                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Solid**  | Fixed shape and volume. Tightly packed particles that vibrate.  | Ice cube, cricket ball, book | SSDs (Solid State Drives): store data in solid semiconductor chips. |
| **Liquid** | Fixed volume, no fixed shape. Particles slide past each other.  | Water, juice, oil            | Liquid Cooling: Used in gaming PCs and servers to remove heat.      |
| **Gas**    | No fixed shape or volume. Particles move freely and spread out. | Steam, perfume, balloon air  | Chip fabrication: Plasma etching, Chemical Vapor Deposition.        |
| **Plasma** | Ionized gas; extremely energetic with charged particles.        | Lightning, neon signs, sun   | Used in chip-making and future tech like nuclear fusion.            |

### 🔁 **Physical Changes**

A **physical change** affects form but **not** chemical identity. The substance stays the same.

#### 🔸 Properties:

- No new substance formed
- Often reversible
- Change in state, size, or shape
- May involve energy but no chemical reaction

#### 🔹 Types:

|**Type**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Change of State**|Melting, boiling, condensation, sublimation, freezing|Ice melting, water boiling, dry ice sublimating|
|**Size/Shape Change**|Cutting, crushing, bending|Paper cutting, can crushing, bending metal|
|**Mixture**|Mixing without chemical reaction|Dissolving sugar, mixing sand & gravel, filtering water|

### ⚗️ **Chemical Changes**

![[Pasted image 20250711144257.png]]


A **chemical change** creates a **new substance** with different properties. Usually **irreversible** and involves **chemical bonds**.

#### 🔸 Properties:

- New substance formed
- Usually irreversible
- Energy change (heat, light)
- Change in molecular structure

#### 🔹 Types of Chemical Reactions:

|**Type**|**Example**|
|---|---|
|**Combustion**|Burning wood or gasoline|
|**Oxidation**|Rusting iron, silver tarnishing|
|**Decomposition**|Electrolysis of water, H₂O₂ breaking down|
|**Neutralization**|Antacid neutralizing stomach acid, acid + base → salt + water|

### 🆚 **Physical vs. Chemical Changes**

|**Feature**|**Physical Change**|**Chemical Change**|
|---|---|---|
|Substance|Remains the same|New substance formed|
|Reversibility|Often reversible|Usually irreversible|
|Energy|Little change|Major energy change|
|Atoms|No molecular change|Molecules rearranged|
|Example|Melting, cutting, mixing|Burning, rusting, cooking|

### 🔁 **Example to Compare**

- **Melting Sugar** → Physical Change
- **Caramelizing Sugar** (heating till it browns) → Chemical Change

### 📌 **Summary**

- You explored **solids, liquids, gases, and plasma**, each with unique particle behavior and real-world uses.
- You learned the difference between **physical changes** (reversible, no new substance) and **chemical changes** (irreversible, new substances).
- These concepts help you understand **everyday changes** and the **science behind tech like SSDs, cooling systems, and chip production**.
