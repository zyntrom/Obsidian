# Acids, Bases, and pH Scale

## 1. Acids and Bases

- **Acid**: Substance that releases H⁺ (hydrogen ions) in solution.  
    Example: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻
- **Base**: Substance that releases OH⁻ (hydroxide ions) in solution.  
    Example: NaOH → Na⁺ + OH⁻

### Common Examples

- **Acids**: Lemon juice (citric acid), vinegar (acetic acid), carbonated drinks (carbonic acid)
- **Bases**: Baking soda (NaHCO₃), soap (NaOH), ammonia solution (NH₃·H₂O)

### Strong vs. Weak

- **Strong acids/bases**: Completely ionize in water.  
    Examples: HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃
- **Weak acids/bases**: Partially ionize.  
    Examples: CH₃COOH, H₂CO₃

## 2. pH and pOH

- **pH = –log [H⁺]**
- **pOH = –log [OH⁻]**
- **Relation**: pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)

### Classification

- pH < 7 → Acidic
- pH = 7 → Neutral
- pH > 7 → Basic

## 3. Acid–Base Equilibrium

- Weak acids/bases establish a **dynamic equilibrium** between ionized and unionized forms.
- Example:  
    CH₃COOH ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ + H⁺

### Definition

**Acid–base equilibrium**: State where the rate of ionization = rate of recombination.

## 4. Dissociation Constants

### Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka)

HA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻  
Ka = ([H⁺][A⁻]) / [HA]

- Higher Ka → Stronger acid
- Lower Ka → Weaker acid

### Base Dissociation Constant (Kb)

BOH ⇌ B⁺ + OH⁻  
Kb = ([OH⁻][B⁺]) / [BOH]

- Higher Kb → Stronger base
- Lower Kb → Weaker base

### Relationship

Ka × Kb = Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)

## 5. Buffer Solutions

- **Definition**: Solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of H⁺ or OH⁻ are added.
- **Components**:
    - Weak acid + conjugate base (e.g., CH₃COOH + CH₃COO⁻)
    - Weak base + conjugate acid (e.g., NH₃ + NH₄⁺)

### Working

- Added H⁺ → neutralized by conjugate base
- Added OH⁻ → neutralized by weak acid

### Henderson–Hasselbalch Equation

pH = pKa + log ([A⁻] / [HA])

### Applications

- Blood buffer system (H₂CO₃ / HCO₃⁻) → maintains pH ~7.4
- Pharmaceuticals → drug stability
- Industry → food processing, fermentation, chemical manufacturing

## 6. Solved Problems

1. [H⁺] = 1 × 10⁻³ M  
    pH = –log(10⁻³) = 3 → Acidic
    
2. [OH⁻] = 2 × 10⁻⁶ M  
    pOH = –log(2 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.7  
    pH = 14 – 5.7 = 8.3 → Basic
    
3. pH = 4.5 → [H⁺] = 10⁻⁴·⁵ ≈ 3.16 × 10⁻⁵ M
    
4. Buffer: 0.50 M CH₃COOH + 0.30 M CH₃COO⁻, pKa = 4.76  
    pH = 4.76 + log(0.30 / 0.50)  
    pH = 4.76 + log(0.6)  
    pH ≈ 4.54

## 7. Practice Questions

1. [H⁺] = 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ M → Find pH & classify
2. pH = 8.7 → Find [H⁺] & [OH⁻], classify
3. Buffer: 0.40 M C₆H₅COOH + 0.25 M C₆H₅COO⁻, pKa = 4.20 → Find pH

## 8. Summary

- **Acids** release H⁺, **Bases** release OH⁻.
- **pH & pOH** indicate acidity/basicity, related by pH + pOH = 14.
- **Ka & Kb** measure ionization strength of weak acids/bases.
- **Buffers** stabilize pH using weak acid–base conjugate pairs.
- **Henderson–Hasselbalch**: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).
