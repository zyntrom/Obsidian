## ðŸ§  **Lesson 5.8 â€” Mastery Project: Water Purification Kit**

### ðŸŒŠ **Context**

You are acting as engineers for a **disaster relief NGO** tasked with designing a **low-cost, efficient, and scalable water purifier** for flood-affected rural areas.

**Key Constraints:**

- Total cost â‰¤ â‚¹300
- No chemical additives (e.g., chlorine)
- Must reduce at least **two impurities**: turbidity, bacteria, or color
- Simple design that a villager can understand

---

### ðŸ›  **Phase 1: Design & Estimate (Digital Prototype)**

**Step 1 â€” Create a Digital Sketch/Diagram**

- Tools: Google Slides, Canva, MS Paint, Figma, etc.
- Example Flow (Simple & Effective):

```
Cloth (pre-filter) â†’ Sand Layer â†’ Charcoal Layer â†’ Fine Gravel â†’ UV Chamber/Sunlight
```
- **Purpose of each layer:**
    - **Cloth:** Removes large debris and particles
    - **Sand:** Filters smaller sediments â†’ turbidity reduction
    - **Charcoal (Activated Carbon):** Adsorbs chemicals, odors, and some bacteria
    - **Gravel:** Supports filtration, prevents sand leakage
    - **UV Chamber/Sunlight:** Disinfects bacteria via UV radiation

**Step 2 â€” Estimate Performance**

|**Parameter**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Estimated Cost|â‚¹250|
|Time to purify 1L|20â€“30 minutes|
|Impurities Removed|Turbidity, Bacteria, Color|
|Maintenance Needed|Low (clean sand/charcoal periodically)|

**Step 3 â€” Iteration / Improvement**

- Idea: Add a **second charcoal layer** or **increase surface area of sand** to improve efficiency.
- Updated Table:

|**Parameter**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Estimated Cost|â‚¹280|
|Time to purify 1L|15â€“20 minutes|
|Impurities Removed|Turbidity, Bacteria, Color (improved)|
|Maintenance Needed|Low|

### ðŸ”¬ **Phase 2: Present & Explain**

**Presentation Structure (2â€“3 minutes):**

1. **Original Design & Purpose:**
    - Multi-layer digital filter to remove particles, bacteria, and color.
    - Purpose: Provide clean water in rural flood-affected areas.
2. **Problem/Limitations Identified:**
    - Filtration speed could be slow.
    - Some impurities not fully removed with single-layer charcoal.
3. **Iteration / Improvement:**
    - Added extra charcoal layer â†’ better adsorption.
    - Adjusted sand surface area â†’ faster flow.
4. **Science & Chemistry Concepts Used:**
    - **Filtration:** Sand and gravel physically remove sediments
    - **Adsorption:** Charcoal traps chemicals and impurities
    - **UV Disinfection:** Sunlight/UV kills bacteria
    - **Sedimentation:** Allows larger particles to settle before filtration
    - **Surface Area Effects:** More sand/charcoal surface â†’ better removal efficiency

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaways:**

- Low-cost and chemical-free water purification is possible using **physical and chemical principles**.
- Iteration and testing improve efficiency and usability.
- Simple visualization and clear explanation are crucial for presenting to a non-technical audience.
