# Notes: Electromagnetic Waves in Wireless Communication (SPE 2025)

## 1. How Do EM Waves Enable Wireless Communication?

- EM waves propagate through space carrying **energy + information**.
- Wireless devices (mobiles, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) rely on **radio/microwave frequencies** for data transfer.
- EM waves don’t need wires/medium → they connect devices instantly.

## 2. How is Information Carried Wirelessly?

### Five Key Steps

1. **Encoding (Converting Info)**
    - Message (text, audio, image) → converted into **binary data (0s & 1s)**.
    - Binary data **modulates** an EM wave (microwave/radio).
    - Modulation types:
        - Amplitude Modulation (AM)
        - Frequency Modulation (FM)
        - Phase Modulation (PM)
2. **Transmission**
    - The modulated EM wave is sent via **phone’s antenna**.
    - Travels at **speed of light** → reaches nearest cell tower or Wi-Fi router.
3. **Routing (Network Infrastructure)**
    - Signal → cell tower/base station → switching centers/servers.
    - Network identifies recipient and routes data correctly.
4. **Reception**
    - Receiver’s antenna detects EM wave.
    - Filters out noise/interference → locks onto correct signal.
5. **Decoding (Demodulation)**
    - Incoming wave demodulated → binary data recovered.
    - Converted back to original format (text, image, audio).

## 3. Examples of Wireless Communication

- **Wi-Fi** → Uses radio waves (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz) to connect to the internet.
- **Bluetooth** → Short-range radio waves → connects headphones, mouse, etc.
- **Cellular/Mobile Networks** → Uses radio waves to connect to towers → supports calls, SMS, data.

## 4. Factors Influencing Signal Range & Speed

1. **Frequency**
    - **High Frequency**: More data, shorter range (fast car analogy).
    - **Low Frequency**: Less data, longer range (truck analogy).
    - Example:
        - 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi → longer range, slower.
        - 5 GHz Wi-Fi → shorter range, faster.
2. **Power**
    - High power → longer range (shouting louder).
    - Low power → shorter range (Bluetooth = low power to save battery).
3. **Obstacles**
    - Walls, trees, buildings reduce/block signals.
    - Metal blocks completely; wood/glass weakens partially.
    - Example: Wi-Fi weaker in houses with thick concrete walls.
4. **Interference**
    - Other EM signals disrupt communication (like noise in a crowded room).
    - Example: Multiple Wi-Fi routers in same area → slower internet.

## 5. Wave Behavior in Communication

- **Reflection** → can cause interference.
- **Refraction** → bending through different materials.
- **Diffraction** → bending around corners (helps signals reach blocked areas).

## 6. Interesting Fact

- **Microwave Ovens**: Use **2.45 GHz frequency** (easily absorbed by water molecules → heating food).

## 7. Case Studies

1. **Wi-Fi Through Walls**
    - Yes, Wi-Fi passes through walls but gets weakened depending on wall material.
