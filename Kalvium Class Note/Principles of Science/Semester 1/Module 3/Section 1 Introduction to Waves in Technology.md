# 📘 Study Notes: _How Does Physics Enable Computing Devices?_

## 🔹 1. Frequency & Amplitude

- **Wave** = disturbance that transfers energy, not matter.
- **Frequency** (Hz) → Number of cycles per second.
    - High frequency → mosquito buzz
    - Low frequency → thunder
- **Amplitude** → Wave height (from rest to peak).
    - Sound: amplitude = loudness
    - Water: amplitude = wave height

- 🎚️ Analogy:
    - Frequency = Pitch (high/low tone)
    - Amplitude = Volume (loud/soft)

## 🔹 2. Types of Waves

1. **Mechanical Waves**
    - Need a medium (air, water, solid).
    - Particles vibrate to transfer energy.
    - Eg: sound waves, water waves.

1. **Electromagnetic Waves**
    - Don’t need a medium.
    - Travel through vacuum.
    - Eg: light, radio, Wi-Fi, X-rays.

## 🔹 3. Modulation & Demodulation

- **Modulation** = Packing data into a carrier wave.
    - Analogy: putting a letter in an envelope.
- **Demodulation** = Extracting original message.
    - Analogy: opening the envelope.
- Together → enable wireless communication (radio, mobile, Wi-Fi).

## 🔹 4. Filtering Noise

- **Problem**: Signals mix with unwanted noise.
- **Solution**: Use filters to keep only useful signal.
- **Types**:
    - Low-pass → only low frequencies pass.
    - High-pass → only high frequencies pass.
    - Band-pass → only a specific range passes.
    - Band-stop → blocks a specific range.
- **Applications**:
    - Audio → clear sound
    - Radio → select correct station
    - Medical (ECG) → remove artifacts

## 🔹 5. Activity (Wave Simulation)

- **Increase frequency** → more waves formed.
- **Increase amplitude** → taller/stronger waves.
- **Boundary conditions**:
    - No End → free continuation
    - Fixed End → reflection inverted
    - Loose End → reflection not inverted

---

## 🔹 Summary

- Waves transfer energy (frequency & amplitude define them).
- Two main types → mechanical & electromagnetic.
- Modulation/Demodulation = pack & unpack signals.
- Filters remove noise → clear & reliable communication.
- Real-life: Wi-Fi, phones, medical devices, audio systems.
