**Q1.** Tom noticed the speaker made the table vibrate slightly.  
The speaker produces sound by vibrating its diaphragm, which pushes air particles to create sound waves. These vibrations are strong enough to transfer into the table, causing it to shake. This shows that sound begins with physical vibrations that can move through solids as well as air.

**Q2.** The speaker’s sound traveled across the room, while the earphone sound felt more private and isolated.  
In both cases, sound waves traveled through air, the medium. The speaker’s larger vibrations spread waves outward, filling the room. Earphones send sound directly into the ear canal, so energy spreads less and feels isolated to the listener.

**Q3.** Tom increased the volume and felt stronger vibrations on the speaker but not the earphones.  
Loudness depends on amplitude—the size of vibrations. A louder speaker means greater amplitude, which produces strong surface vibrations you can feel. Earphones use smaller, focused vibrations near the ear, so the increase in amplitude is heard clearly but felt less physically.

**Q4.** Both devices were playing the same song, but the sound experience was different.  
The speaker spreads sound energy over a large area, creating powerful but less isolated waves. Earphones deliver concentrated waves directly to the ears, with minimal energy loss. As a result, the speaker feels immersive and room-filling, while earphones give a more focused and detailed listening experience.

**Q5.** Imagine Tom now wants to explain to his younger sibling how sound travels through both devices.  
Sound comes from vibrations. The speaker makes big vibrations that move through air (the medium) and spread everywhere. Earphones make small vibrations that also travel through air but go straight into your ears. Bigger vibrations mean louder sounds, and the medium helps carry them to us.
