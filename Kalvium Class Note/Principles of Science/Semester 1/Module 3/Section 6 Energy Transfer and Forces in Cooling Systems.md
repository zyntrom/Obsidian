# Notes: Energy Transfer and Forces in Cooling Systems (SPE 2025)

## 1. Why Do Devices Get Hot?

- **Reason**: Electrical energy → converted to thermal energy due to **resistance** in components.
- **Analogy**: Like friction in motion → resistance causes heating in circuits.
- **Common situations**: Phone heating during long calls, laptop fan running during gaming.

## 2. What Causes Heat Generation?

- **Main cause**: Electrical resistance (electron collisions → atoms vibrate → heat).
- **Key heat-generating components**:
    - **CPU / GPU** → billions of transistors switching.
    - **RAM & Memory Modules** → continuous data handling.
    - **Power Supplies** → high current conversion.
    - **Batteries** → charging/discharging.
    - **Display Panels** → continuous energy draw.

## 3. Heat Transfer Mechanisms

1. **Conduction**
    - Heat transfer through solids (direct contact).
    - Example: Heat sink spreading heat from CPU.
2. **Convection**
    - Heat transfer by fluid movement (air or liquid).
    - Example: Fans blowing air, liquid cooling in PCs/EVs.
3. **Radiation**
    - Heat emitted as electromagnetic waves.
    - Example: Satellites radiating heat into space.

## 4. How Do Devices Manage Heat?

### (A) Passive Cooling

- No moving parts, no extra energy used.
- Uses conductive materials (copper, aluminum).
- Example: Heat sinks, graphite sheets in phones.
- Analogy: Like a house with thick walls & natural airflow.
![[Pasted image 20250826003546.png]]
### (B) Active Cooling

- Uses powered components (fans, pumps).
- Example: Laptop/PC fans, liquid pumps.
- Analogy: Turning on ceiling fans/AC in a hot house.

### (C) Hybrid Cooling

- Combines passive + active cooling.
- Example: Heat sinks + fans (laptops, gaming PCs).
- Analogy: House with insulation + fans + AC.

## 5. Case Study 1: Heat Dissipation in CPUs & GPUs

1. **Passive Cooling (Heat Sinks)**
    - Made of copper/aluminum.
    - Larger surface area = better dissipation (fins/ridges).
    - Uses thermal paste for efficient transfer.
![[Pasted image 20250826003702.png]]
2. **Active Cooling (Fans & Airflow)**
    - Fans move hot air out, draw cool air in.
    - Efficiency depends on speed (RPM), placement, dust control.
![[Pasted image 20250826003712.png]]
3. **Liquid Cooling**
    - Uses pump, cold plate, radiator, coolant.
    - More efficient than air cooling.
    - Common in gaming rigs, servers.
4. **Phase-Change Cooling**
    - Thermal paste → fills air gaps.
    - Vapor chambers → spread heat evenly (used in GPUs, laptops).

1. **Advanced Cooling**
    - Peltier (TEC) coolers → move heat using current.
    - Immersion cooling → components submerged in dielectric liquid (data centers).

## 6. Case Study 2: Why Liquid Cooling in Gaming PCs?

- **Advantages**:
    - Higher thermal conductivity than air → better cooling.
    - Quieter (slower, larger fans).
    - Maintains stable temps during heavy loads (overclocking, gaming).
- **Results**:
    - Better FPS, stable performance.
    - Less thermal throttling.
