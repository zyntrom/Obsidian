## 🎢 Project Option 1: Mini Roller Coaster Challenge

### 📌 Goal

Explore how **ramp angle** and **surface type** affect motion and speed.

### 🔧 Materials (via PhET Simulation)
- Surface types: **Wooden**, **Icy**
- Adjustable ramp angles: 10°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°

---

### 🧪 Step-by-Step

#### 1. Setup

- Access the **PhET Ramp Forces and Motion Simulator**
- Choose a surface (Wood or Ice)
- Select and test 5 ramp angles (10°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°)

#### 2. Observation

For each combination, record:

- Time taken to reach the bottom
- Speed characteristics
- Behavior of motion

**Suggested Observation Table:**

|Surface|Angle (°)|Time (s)|Speed|Motion Behavior|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Wood|10||||
|...|...|...|...|...|

#### 3. Analysis

Reflect on these questions:

- What happens to **speed and time** as angle increases?
- Which angle/surface combo had the **slowest motion**, and why?
- At which angle did **no movement occur**, and why?
- What **other materials** could allow movement in such cases?

---

### ⚙️ Simulator Instructions

1. Start with angle = 0°, place box at far right.
2. Adjust to the next angle (10°, 30°...), observe.
3. Repeat for each surface type.
4. Use a stopwatch to measure time for each test.

## ⚖️ Project Option 2: Newton’s Cradle Exploration

### 📌 Goal

Observe **momentum** and **energy transfer** through collisions.

### 🔧 Tools

Use the **Newton’s Cradle Simulator (JavaLab)**

---

### 🧪 Step-by-Step

#### 1. Initial Observations

- Release 1 or more balls
- Observe motion and energy transfer

#### 2. Enable Friction

- Note changes in motion
- Explain gradual slowing due to **friction**

#### 3. Investigate & Reflect

**Questions to Explore:**

- Why does the **opposite ball swing** outward?
- What if the balls were **sponge/rubber**?
- Which force **slows the cradle down**?

#### 4. Change Mass of One Ball

- Observe motion change
- Explain with **momentum & energy conservation**

#### 5. Change Mass of All Balls

- Make all heavier or lighter
- Record how **speed, impact, duration** are affected

---

### ⚙️ Simulator Instructions

1. Access Newton’s Cradle – JavaLab
2. Wait for full load
3. Begin the simulation and perform the steps above

---

## 🧠 Example Comparisons

- A **60° slope** makes a marble move faster than at 30° due to a stronger gravity component.
- In **Newton’s Cradle**, metal balls transfer energy efficiently. Sponge or rubber balls absorb energy, reducing the reaction.

## 📌 Summary

- **Roller Coaster Project** explores how **angle** and **surface** affect acceleration.
- **Newton’s Cradle** demonstrates **conservation of momentum** and **energy transfer**.
- Both projects reinforce core physics principles through **hands-on simulation**.
