### 🧠 **Core Concept: Mechanics**

**Definition**: Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with motion and the forces that cause motion.

#### 🔍 **Three Branches of Mechanics**

|Branch|Focus|
|---|---|
|Kinematics|Describes motion without causes|
|Dynamics|Explains motion with forces (cause-effect)|
|Statics|Analyzes forces on objects at rest|

### ⚙️ **Physical Quantities**

#### Scalars vs. Vectors

|Quantity|Scalar or Vector|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|Distance|Scalar|Total path length|
|Displacement|Vector|Shortest path from start to end (with direction)|
|Speed|Scalar|How fast something is moving|
|Velocity|Vector|Speed with direction|
|Acceleration|Vector|Change in velocity over time|

🧪 **Units to Know**:

- Distance/Displacement: **meter (m)**
- Speed/Velocity: **m/s**
- Acceleration: **m/s²**

### 🧱 **Statics**

Focuses on **objects at rest**.

#### 🧲 Key Concepts:

- **Force**: Push/pull on an object.
- **Equilibrium**: Net force & torque = 0
- **Moment (Torque)**: Turning effect of force → `Moment = Force × Distance`
- **Resultant Force**: A single force representing all acting forces.

✅ **Conditions for Equilibrium**:

1. ∑F = 0 (No net force)
2. ∑τ = 0 (No net torque)

### 🚀 **Dynamics**

Explains **why** motion happens — using **Newton’s Laws**.

#### Newton’s Laws:

1. **Law of Inertia**: An object stays at rest or in uniform motion unless acted on by a force.
2. **F = ma**: Acceleration is proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass.
3. **Action-Reaction**: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

### 🧮 **Kinematics**

Describes motion without forces.
#### Key Quantities:
- **Displacement**: Δx = x₁ - x₀
- **Velocity**:
    - Average: `v̄ = Δx / Δt`
    - Instantaneous: Velocity at a specific moment
- **Acceleration**:
    - Average: `a = Δv / Δt`
    - Instantaneous: Acceleration at a moment

🧩 Example:

> A car goes from 10 m/s to 30 m/s in 5 seconds  
> ➤ a = (30 - 10)/5 = **4 m/s²**

### 📏 **Units of Measurement**

|Quantity|Unit|Symbol|
|---|---|---|
|Length|meter|m|
|Mass|kilogram|kg|
|Time|second|s|
|Force|newton|N|
|Energy|joule|J|
|Power|watt|W|
|Pressure|pascal|Pa|

💡 **Tip**: Always **match units** (e.g., kg for mass) to avoid wrong answers in calculations.
