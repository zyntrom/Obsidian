## **1. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**

- Every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force.
- Formula: F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²
    - F: Gravitational force
    - G: Gravitational constant = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ Nm²/kg²
    - m₁, m₂: Masses of the two objects
    - r: Distance between their centers
- Force is always **attractive**.
- Acts along the line joining the centers of the two masses.

## **2. Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)**

- Energy possessed by an object due to its position in a gravitational field.
- Formula: U = -G * (M * m) / r
    - U: Gravitational potential energy
    - M: Mass of the planet
    - m: Mass of the object
    - r: Distance between centers
- Negative sign: Work must be done to separate the masses (bound system).

## **3. Acceleration Due to Gravity (g)**

- g = G * (M / R²)
    - M: Mass of Earth
    - R: Radius of Earth
- On Earth: g ≈ 9.8 m/s²
    
- g **decreases** with:
    - **Altitude** (higher = weaker gravity)
    - **Depth** (underground = weaker gravity)
    - **Latitude** (strongest at poles, weakest at equator due to Earth's shape and rotation)

## **4. Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion**

- **1st Law (Law of Orbits):** Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
- **2nd Law (Law of Areas):** A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time. (→ faster near the Sun)
- **3rd Law (Law of Periods):** The square of the time period (T²) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (r³).
    - T² ∝ r³

## **5. Applications & Observations**

- Artificial satellites use the balance of gravity and inertia to orbit Earth.
- Astronauts feel weightless because both they and the spacecraft are in **free fall**.
- Gravitational force affects tides, orbits, and planetary motion.
- Gravity keeps the Moon in orbit around Earth and Earth around the Sun.
