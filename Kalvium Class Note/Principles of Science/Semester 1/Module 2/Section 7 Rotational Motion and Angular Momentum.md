## 1. Introduction to Rotational Motion

- **Rotational motion** occurs when an object spins around a fixed axis.
- Real-world examples:
    - Spinning basketball
    - Ferris wheel
    - Ceiling fan

Rotational motion is analogous to linear motion, but instead of straight-line displacement and velocity, it uses angular quantities.

## 2. Rotational Kinematics

### A. Angular Displacement (θ)

- **Definition**: The angle through which an object rotates about a fixed axis.
- **Formula**: θ = s / r
    - θ: Angular displacement (radians)
    - s: Arc length
    - r: Radius of the circle
- **Unit**: Radians (rad)
- **Example**: If a wheel of radius 0.5 m rolls 1 m,  
    θ = 1 / 0.5 = 2 rad

---

### B. Angular Velocity (ω)

- **Definition**: Rate of change of angular displacement.
- **Formula**: ω = Δθ / Δt
    - ω: Angular velocity (rad/s)
    - Δθ: Change in angular displacement
    - Δt: Time taken
- **Unit**: Radians per second (rad/s)
- **Example**: One rotation (2π rad) per second → ω = 2π rad/s

---

### C. Angular Acceleration (α)

- **Definition**: Rate of change of angular velocity.
- **Formula**: α = Δω / Δt
- **Unit**: Radians per second squared (rad/s²)
- **Example**: Fan accelerates from 0 to 10 rad/s in 2 s → α = 5 rad/s²

---

## 3. Torque (τ)

- **Definition**: The measure of the force that causes an object to rotate.
- **Formula**: τ = F × r × sin(θ)
    - τ: Torque (Nm)
    - F: Force applied
    - r: Distance from the axis
    - θ: Angle between force and lever arm
- **Real-life example**: Longer wrench = more torque

## 4. Moment of Inertia (I)

- **Definition**: A measure of an object’s resistance to changes in its rotational motion.
- **Basic Formula**: I = m × R²
    - m: Mass of the object
    - R: Distance from the axis of rotation

### Moment of Inertia for Common Shapes:

- **Solid Cylinder** (about its axis): I = (1/2) × m × r²
- **Thin Hoop** (about its axis): I = m × r²
- **Solid Sphere** (about its axis): I = (2/5) × m × r²

### Example Calculations:

- Solid cylinder: I = 0.01 kg m² (m = 2 kg, r = 0.1 m)
- Thin hoop: I = 0.04 kg m² (m = 1 kg, r = 0.2 m)
- Solid sphere: I = 0.003 kg m² (m = 3 kg, r = 0.05 m)

## 5. Mass Distribution and Rotation

- **Mass closer to axis** → smaller I → easier to rotate
- **Mass farther from axis** → larger I → harder to rotate

---

## 6. Angular Momentum (L)

- **Definition**: A quantity that measures the rotational motion of an object.
- **Formula**: L = I × ω
    - L: Angular momentum
    - I: Moment of inertia
    - ω: Angular velocity

---

## 7. Conservation of Angular Momentum

- **Law**: If no external torque acts on a system, its total angular momentum remains constant.
- **Formula**: I₁ × ω₁ = I₂ × ω₂
- **Implication**: Reducing moment of inertia increases angular velocity, and vice versa.

### Example: Figure Skater

- I₁ = 4 kg m², ω₁ = 2 rad/s
- I₂ = 1 kg m²
- ω₂ = (I₁ × ω₁) / I₂ = (4 × 2) / 1 = 8 rad/s
- Skater spins faster when arms are pulled in.

## 8. Activity: Spin Doctor

**Objective**: Demonstrate conservation of angular momentum

**Steps**:

1. Sit on a rotating stool with weights.
2. Spin slowly with arms close to body.
3. Extend arms — spin slows down.
4. Pull arms in — spin speeds up.

**Explanation**:

- Extending arms increases I → ω decreases
- Pulling in arms decreases I → ω increases

## 9. Summary

- **Rotational motion** is described by angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
- **Torque** is the cause of angular acceleration.
- **Moment of inertia** is the rotational equivalent of mass.
- **Angular momentum** remains conserved in the absence of external torque.
- Real-world applications include figure skating, rocket motion, and rotating machinery.
