# **Gravitation – Fundamentals of Physics**

---

## **1. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation**

### **Definition:**

- Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force.
- This force is **directly proportional** to the product of their masses and **inversely proportional** to the square of the distance between them.

### **Formula:**

F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²

- **F**: Gravitational force (N)
- **G**: Universal gravitational constant = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg²
- **m1, m2**: Masses of the two objects (kg)
- **r**: Distance between their centers (m)

### **Key Features:**

- Force is **mutual**: Both objects experience equal and opposite force.
- It’s a **non-contact**, attractive force.
- Acts along the line joining the centers of the two masses.

## **2. Gravitational Field and Gravitational Acceleration**

### **Gravitational Field Strength (g):**

- g = F / m = G * (M / r²)
- **M** is the mass of the planet (e.g., Earth)
- Units: N/kg or m/s²

## **3. Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)**

### **Definition:**

- Energy possessed by an object due to its position in a gravitational field.

### **Formula:**

GPE = -G * (m1 * m2) / r

- Negative sign: Gravitational force is attractive.
- Energy increases (becomes less negative) as objects move apart.

## **4. Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion**

### **First Law – Law of Ellipses:**

- Planets orbit the sun in **elliptical paths**, with the sun at one **focus**.

### **Second Law – Law of Equal Areas:**

- A line joining a planet and the sun sweeps **equal areas in equal intervals of time**.
- Meaning: Planets move **faster** when closer to the sun, **slower** when farther.

### **Third Law – Law of Harmonies:**

- The square of the orbital period (T²) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (r³) of its orbit.

Formula: T² ∝ r³

## **5. Variation in Gravitational Acceleration (g) on Earth**

### **Factors Affecting g:**

- **Altitude**: g decreases with increase in height from Earth’s surface.
- **Depth**: g decreases as you go below the surface.
- **Latitude**: g is **maximum at poles**, **minimum at equator** due to Earth’s rotation.

### **Why?**

- Earth is not a perfect sphere → equatorial bulge → larger radius at equator.

## **6. Real-Life Applications**

- **Satellite Orbits**: Governed by balance between gravitational pull and inertia.
- **Tides**: Caused by gravitational force of the moon and sun.
- **Space Missions**: Trajectories designed using laws of gravitation.
- **Weight Variation**: Weight (W = m * g) varies based on g at location.
