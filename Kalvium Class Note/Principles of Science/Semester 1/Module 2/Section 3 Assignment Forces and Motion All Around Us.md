### üß≤ **What is Force?**

- A **push or pull** acting on an object.
- **Has direction and magnitude**.
- Changes an object‚Äôs:
    - Speed
    - Direction
    - Shape

üí° **Formula (Newton‚Äôs 2nd Law)**:  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**F = m √ó a**

### üß∞ **Types of Forces**

#### **1. Contact Forces** (require physical touch):

- **Applied Force** ‚Äì pushing or pulling
- **Frictional Force** ‚Äì resists motion
- **Tension** ‚Äì in strings or ropes
- **Normal Force** ‚Äì upward force from a surface
- **Air Resistance** ‚Äì opposes motion through air
- **Spring Force** ‚Äì elastic restoring force
- **Muscular Force** ‚Äì human/animal effort

#### **2. Non-Contact Forces** (act at a distance):

- **Gravitational Force** ‚Äì pull due to mass
- **Electrostatic Force** ‚Äì between charges
- **Magnetic Force** ‚Äì magnets‚Äô interaction
- **Nuclear Force** ‚Äì holds atomic nuclei together

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced vs Unbalanced Forces**

|Type|Description|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|**Balanced**|Equal & opposite forces|No change in motion|
|**Unbalanced**|Unequal forces|Object accelerates (changes speed/direction)|

### üõû **Friction**

- **Definition**: Opposes motion between surfaces.
- **Types**:
    - **Static**: Before motion starts
    - **Kinetic**: While sliding
- **Factors affecting it**:
    - Surface texture
    - Normal force
    - Coefficient of friction (Œº)
- **Helpful**: Walking, grip, braking
- **Harmful**: Wear, heat in machines
- **Reduced by**: Lubricants, ball bearings, streamlining

---

### üîÑ **Circular Motion**

- Object moves in a curved path.
- **Uniform**: Constant speed
- **Non-uniform**: Changing speed
- **Key Terms**:
    - **Centripetal Force**: Inward force (real)
    - **Centripetal Acceleration**: Changes direction
    - **Tangential Velocity**: Speed along the curve
    - **Centrifugal Force**: Outward _apparent_ force (not real)

### üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Situation 1: _Cyclist on a Curved Uphill Road_

#### **Forces Acting**:

- Gravitational (downward)
- Normal (upward)
- Applied (from pedaling)
- Friction (for grip, braking, turning)
- Air Resistance (opposes motion)
- Centripetal Force (for turning)

#### **Net Force**:

- During acceleration: forward + uphill
- On curve: inward (centripetal)
- During braking: backward (due to friction)

#### **Problem Solving**:

- **Given**:

##### d) Role of Friction:

- Prevents slipping
- Provides centripetal force for turning
- Enables safe braking

### üöÄ Situation 2: _Rocket Launch_

#### **Forces Acting**:

- **Thrust** (upward)
- **Gravity** (downward)
- **Air Resistance** (downward)
- **Normal Force** only at launch pad

#### **Net Force**:

- During ascent: **Thrust - (Gravity + Air Resistance)** = net upward force
- After engine cutoff: net downward (gravity + air drag)

#### **Problem Solving**:

##### d) Role of Air Resistance & Thrust:

- **Thrust** must overcome gravity + air resistance
- **Air resistance** slows rocket after engine cutoff
- Gravity causes deceleration upward

‚úÖ **Summary**:

- Forces drive all motion ‚Äî use Newton's Laws to analyze them.
- Friction and circular motion are critical in real-world mechanics (turning, launching).
- Solve problems using equations of motion and Newton‚Äôs Second Law.
