## üåÄ Forces and Motion All Around Us (SPE 2025)

---

### üåü 1. What is Force?

- **Definition**: A push or a pull on an object.
- **Causes**:
    - Start/stop motion
    - Change direction
    - Change speed
    - Change shape

---

### üîó 2. Types of Forces

#### üü¢ A. Contact Forces

> Forces that act through physical contact

- **Applied Force** ‚Äì a push/pull (e.g., pushing a box)
- **Frictional Force** ‚Äì opposes motion (e.g., brakes on a bike)
- **Air Resistance** ‚Äì slows objects moving through air
- **Tension Force** ‚Äì via ropes/strings (e.g., tug-of-war)
- **Normal Force** ‚Äì support from surface (e.g., book on a table)

#### üîµ B. Non-Contact Forces

> Forces that act at a distance without touching

- **Gravitational Force** ‚Äì Earth's pull on objects
- **Magnetic Force** ‚Äì attraction/repulsion between magnets
- **Electrostatic Force** ‚Äì between charged particles

### ‚öñÔ∏è 3. Balanced and Unbalanced Forces

- **Balanced Forces**:
    - Equal in size, opposite in direction
    - No change in motion (object stays still or moves uniformly)
- **Unbalanced Forces**:
    - One force is stronger than the other
    - Causes acceleration or change in motion

---

### üß† 4. Newton's Laws of Motion (Simplified)

- **1st Law (Inertia)**:
 > An object stays at rest or in motion unless acted on by an external force.
- **2nd Law**:
> Force = Mass √ó Acceleration (F = ma)
- **3rd Law**:
> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Role of Friction

- Helps in walking, gripping, and stopping
- Opposes motion
- Produces heat
- Can cause wear and tear
- Can be reduced using:
    - Lubricants
    - Ball bearings
    - Streamlining

### üéØ 6. Circular Motion

- **Definition**: Motion of an object along a circular path
- **Key Terms**:
    - **Centripetal Force**: Inward force that keeps object moving in a circle
    - **Tangential Velocity**: Speed along the edge of the circle
    - **Acceleration**: Changes direction continuously, even if speed is constant

### ü§ñ 7. Real-World Applications

|Application Area|How Forces Are Involved|
|---|---|
|**Robotics**|Motors apply force to joints for movement|
|**Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)**|Circular motion of platters, friction in bearings|
|**Ring Network Topology**|Data packets move in circular path, like motion in circular systems|

### üìù Summary Points

- All motion is caused by forces ‚Äî either contact or non-contact.
- Balanced forces mean no motion change; unbalanced cause movement.
- Newton's laws explain all types of motion.
- Friction helps but can also be a problem.
- Circular motion needs continuous inward force.
