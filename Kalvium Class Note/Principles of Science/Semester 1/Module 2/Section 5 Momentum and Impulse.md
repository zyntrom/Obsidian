## 🧭 **What is Momentum?**

- Momentum is **how much motion** an object has.
- Depends on:
    - **Mass (m)** – how heavy the object is
    - **Velocity (v)** – how fast and in which direction it moves
- **Formula**: **p = m × v**
- **Units**: kg·m/s
- **Type**: Vector → has direction

🧠 _Why direction matters:_  
Two identical cars going in **opposite** directions cancel each other's momentum in a collision—so **direction affects the total**.

### 🔍 Example:

- Truck (3000 kg @ 2 m/s): p = 3000 × 2 = **6000 kg·m/s**
- Bicycle (15 kg @ 10 m/s): p = 15 × 10 = **150 kg·m/s**

🚚 The truck has more momentum—so it’s harder to stop even if it’s slower!

## 💥 **What is Impulse?**

- Impulse is the **force applied over a time** period to change momentum.
- **Formula**: **J = F × Δt**
- **Units**: N·s (Newton-seconds)
- Also: **J = Δp** (Impulse causes change in momentum)

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

- Pushing a car for 2 seconds vs 10 seconds = longer push → more change in momentum

## 📐 **Impulse-Momentum Theorem**

Describes how force changes an object’s motion:

>  **F × Δt = m × Δv**

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|F|Force applied (N)|
|Δt|Time duration (s)|
|m|Mass of object (kg)|
|Δv|Change in velocity (m/s)|

### ✅ Example:

You kick a 0.45 kg soccer ball with 50 N for 0.1 s:

1. **Impulse** = 50 × 0.1 = **5 Ns**
2. **Δv** = 5 / 0.45 = **11.11 m/s** (change in velocity in the force direction)

## 🧰 **Impulse in Real Life**

|Situation|How Impulse Helps|
|---|---|
|**Airbags**|Increase time of impact → reduce force|
|**Catching a ball**|Pulling hand back → increases time → reduces force|
|**Golf/Baseball swing**|Follow-through increases time → more change in motion|

## 🔁 **Law of Conservation of Momentum**

In a **closed system** (no external forces):

>  **Total momentum before = Total momentum after**

### 💡 Formula:

**m₁v₁ + m₂v₂ = m₁v₁′ + m₂v₂′**

- Works for collisions, pushes, and explosions
- Momentum can be **transferred** between objects, but total stays **constant**

## ⚽ **Types of Collisions**

|Type|Momentum|Kinetic Energy|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Elastic**|✅|✅|No energy loss; objects bounce cleanly|Steel balls on track|
|**Inelastic**|✅|❌|Some energy lost (sound, heat, deformation)|Football hitting ground|
|**Perfectly Inelastic**|✅|❌❌|Objects stick together; max energy loss|Clay blobs merging|

### 🧮 Collision Example:

Two skaters push off:

- Skater A: 60 kg @ -2 m/s → p = -120
- Skater B: 80 kg @ ? → p = +120 → v = 1.5 m/s

Total momentum before: 0  
Total after: Still 0 → **momentum conserved**

---

## 💣 **What is an Explosion?**

- An object breaks into **multiple pieces**
- Momentum is still **conserved**:
    > If one part moves with +p, another must move with -p

### 🎇 Example:

Toy bomb explodes at rest → fragments fly apart in **opposite directions**  
Initial p = 0 → Final total p = 0
