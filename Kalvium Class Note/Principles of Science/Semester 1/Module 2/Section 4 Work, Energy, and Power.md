## ⚡️ Energy – The Ability to Do Work

- **Energy** makes all motion and change possible.
- **SI Unit**: Joule (J)

- **Law of Conservation of Energy**:  
    ➤ _"Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it only changes form."_

### 🔄 Types of Energy:

#### 1. **Kinetic Energy (KE)**

 • Energy of a moving object  
 • Depends on **mass (m)** and **velocity (v)**  
 • Formula: **KE = ½ × m × v²**

🔹 _Example_:  
A 2 kg ball rolling at 3 m/s:  
 KE = ½ × 2 × 3² = 9 J

#### 2. **Potential Energy (PE)**

 • Stored energy due to **position** (like height) or **condition** (like stretch)  
 • Gravitational PE formula: **PE = m × g × h**

🔹 _Example_:  
A 1.5 kg book held 2 m above the ground:  
 PE = 1.5 × 9.8 × 2 = 29.4 J

## 🔁 Energy Conversion

- Energy is always **transferred or transformed**, e.g.:
    - Roller coaster: PE → KE
    - Human body: Chemical → Mechanical
    - Fan: Electrical → Kinetic + Heat
- **Friction and air resistance** convert mechanical energy into heat.

## 🔧 Work – Energy in Action

- **Work** is done **only** if a force moves an object.
- **Formula**:  
     **W = F × d × cos(θ)**  
     Where:  
      • F = Force (N)  
      • d = Distance (m)  
      • θ = Angle between force & motion direction  
      • W = Work done (J)

🔹 _Example_:  
Force = 10 N, Distance = 5 m, θ = 0°  
 W = 10 × 5 × cos(0) = **50 J**

### 🚫 No Work Happens If:

- Object doesn't move.
- Force is perpendicular to movement.
- Example: Holding a bag stationary.

## 🏛 Conservation of Mechanical Energy

- In an **ideal (frictionless)** system:  
     **E_total = KE + PE = constant**
    

### 🧮 Formula:

**E_initial = E_final**  

or  

**KE_initial + PE_initial = KE_final + PE_final**

### 📌 Conditions:

✅ No friction or air resistance  
✅ Only conservative forces (e.g., gravity, springs)

### 🔁 Real-Life Examples:

- **Pendulum**: Swings between KE and PE
- **Roller Coaster**: Hilltop PE → bottom KE
- **Falling Ball**: PE → KE before hitting ground

🔹 _Example_:  
A 0.5 kg ball dropped from 10 m:  
 PE_initial = m × g × h = 0.5 × 9.8 × 10 = 49 J  
 At bottom: KE = ½ × m × v² = 49  
 Solving: v = √(2gh) = √(2 × 9.8 × 10) ≈ **14 m/s**

## ⚙️ Power – How Fast Work is Done

- **Power (P)** = Work done ÷ Time  
     **P = W / t**

### ⚡️ Units of Power:

|Unit|Value|
|---|---|
|**Watt (W)**|1 J/s|
|**Kilowatt**|1000 W|
|**Horsepower**|≈ 746 W|
🔹 _Example 1_:  
600 J of work in 10 s:  
 P = 600 / 10 = **60 W**

🔹 _Example 2_:  
2 kW motor used for 3 hours:  
 Energy = Power × Time = 2 × 3 = **6 kWh**
