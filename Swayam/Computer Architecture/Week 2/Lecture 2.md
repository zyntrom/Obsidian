## üìò Chapter 2 (Continued): Binary Arithmetic and Overflow

### üî¢ Binary Addition

#### ‚û§ Rules for Binary Addition (like decimal, but with 0 and 1):

|A|B|Carry-in|Sum|Carry-out|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|1|0|
|1|0|0|1|0|
|1|1|0|0|1|
|1|1|1|1|1|

- Binary addition is **associative and commutative**, just like decimal.

### ‚ûï Signed Binary Arithmetic

#### ‚û§ Using 2's Complement

- Easy arithmetic because both positive and negative numbers are in one system.
- No special handling needed while adding:
    - Add both numbers directly.
    - Discard carry beyond MSB (if it exists).

##### Example:

```c
  +5  = 00000101   
  -2  = 11111110  
  (2's complement of 2: invert 00000010 ‚Üí 11111101, add 1)   
  Sum = 00000011 = +3
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Overflow Detection in Binary Arithmetic

#### ‚û§ Unsigned Overflow

- If a carry-out from the **MSB** occurs ‚Üí **overflow**.
- Example (8-bit):
```
11111111 (255) + 00000001 = 00000000 ‚Üí overflow
```

#### ‚û§ Signed Overflow (2's Complement)

- Happens **only when adding two numbers of same sign** gives a result of opposite sign.

##### Overflow occurs if:

- Positive + Positive = Negative
- Negative + Negative = Positive

##### Example:

```
  +100 = 01100100   
  +40  = 00101000   
  ----------------   
  Sum  = 10001100 ‚Üí -116 in 2's complement ‚Üí Wrong ‚Üí Overflow
```

##### Detection Rule:

- **Check the sign of the operands and result**.
    - If signs of operands are same, and sign of result is different ‚Üí **overflow**.

### ‚ûñ Binary Subtraction

- Use **2's complement method**:
    - `A - B` = `A + (2's complement of B)`

##### Example:

```c
  A = 00000101  (+5)   
  B = 00000010  (+2)    
  2‚Äôs complement of B = 11111110   
  Sum = 00000101 + 11111110 = 00000011 ‚Üí +3

```

### ‚úÖ Advantages of 2's Complement Arithmetic

- **Only one representation for 0**
- **Same circuitry** for addition and subtraction
- **Simpler overflow detection logic**
- Arithmetic is **consistent and fast**

---

### üß† Summary

- Binary arithmetic follows strict rules and needs overflow detection.
- Unsigned overflow = carry out of MSB.
- Signed overflow = sign anomaly.
- 2‚Äôs complement simplifies binary arithmetic and hardware design.
